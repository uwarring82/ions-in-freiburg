# Introduction to Materials for Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) Applications

In ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, where pressures can drop below 10^{-9} Torr, the choice of materials is critical to maintain the vacuum and ensure the stability of experiments or processes. Key considerations for UHV materials include low outgassing, thermal stability, mechanical strength, and chemical resistance.

Outgassing refers to the release of gases trapped or adsorbed on material surfaces, which can degrade the vacuum. Materials like stainless steel, aluminum, and copper are commonly used due to their low outgassing properties and mechanical durability after proper cleaning and bakeout. For components such as seals, Viton and Kapton provide a balance of flexibility and low outgassing, though they are used with temperature limitations. Materials like Teflon are less suitable due to their relatively high outgassing.

Careful selection and preparation of materials are vital for maintaining the integrity of UHV systems. Here is a list of materials to consider:
