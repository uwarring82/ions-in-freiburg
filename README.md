# Welcome to the Open-Science Harbour: Ions in Freiburg

This harbour serves as a resource centre for trapped-ion quantum physics research—a place to gather frameworks, prepare for scientific exploration, and share findings. It documents both global (G) scientific principles and local (L) practices. Global content describes methods or constraints that should transfer across laboratories and research fields. Local content reflects our particular equipment, choices, and experiences at this node at the University of Freiburg. This dual scope serves complementary purposes but can create confusion about what applies universally versus locally—so we label everything explicitly.

#### Lock-Key Open Science

This documentation applies a lock-and-key approach: locks are stable, falsifiable frameworks that define boundaries—they remain fixed to enable verification across groups and serve as global (long-range and long-term) anchors. Keys are interpretive, context-specific implementations—they show how particular communities unlock and apply those frameworks. Global frameworks act as locks for scientific coordination; local practices provide keys for operational work. Neither is authoritative over the other—locks establish what must hold, keys demonstrate what can be done.

This separation allows global scientific principles to stabilise while local ion-trapping practices evolve independently. Different laboratories can verify the same framework (lock) while developing distinct implementations (keys) suited to their equipment and questions.

#### Local and Global Constituents

Locally, around fifteen researchers at the University of Freiburg contribute to work spanning quantum control, precision sensing, and experimental platform development. This documentation reflects our evolving practices and insights.

Globally, this work engages with broader institutional structures: university research systems, precision measurement infrastructures, international atomic physics communities, and open repositories for scientific knowledge. These global constituents provide the coordination layer—shared measurement standards, verification protocols, and knowledge commons—that enables local groups to develop compatible but distinct approaches.

All content is openly shared as living documentation, updated as experiments evolve.

### How to Navigate This Harbour

#### Document Types (organised in groups)

**Frameworks** define concepts through minimal, falsifiable conditions. They specify boundaries (what cannot be violated) without prescribing methods. These are locks—they serve as anchors, providing global long-term and long-range stability.

**Essays** provide interpretation, motivation, and context. They reflect specific perspectives and are not normative. These are keys—they generate winds that create local pull towards exploration.

**Interfaces** document operational practices for specific contexts. They instantiate frameworks but are neither unique nor authoritative. These are also keys—they mark buoys showing navigable channels for local voyages.

#### Scope Labels (in page titles)

**(G) Global** — Applies across contexts. Should be verifiable independently of our setup.

**(L) Local** — Particular to Freiburg laboratory. Documents what we do here.

**Examples:**\
`G – Causal Clock Unification Framework` (lock—universal boundary)\
`L – The Bias I Carry` (key—local perspective)\
`L – Structure Your Research` (key—our implementation)

**Check groups for types and page titles for scope (G/L). This harbour provides anchors for stability, charts for coordination, and understanding of winds and buoys for flexible navigation.**
