# Welcome to Open-Science-Freiburg

This site provides structured guidance for our experimental physics research with trapped atomic ions. It brings together methods, concepts, and practical knowledge used within the group, serving both as a reference and as a source of inspiration for ongoing work.

All sections are maintained as living documents—continuously updated as experiments evolve, techniques improve, and new insights emerge. Feedback is highly valued and actively encouraged, as it helps refine the material and strengthen its usefulness for students, collaborators, and future researchers.
