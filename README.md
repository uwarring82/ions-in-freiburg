# Welcome to the Open-Science Harbour: Ions in Freiburg

## Welcome to the Open-Science Harbour: Ions in Freiburg

This harbour serves as a resource centre for trapped-ion quantum physics research—a place to gather frameworks, prepare for scientific exploration, and share findings. It documents both global (G) scientific principles and local (L) practices. Global content describes methods or constraints that should transfer across laboratories and research fields. Local content reflects our particular equipment, choices, and experiences at this node at the University of Freiburg. This dual scope serves complementary purposes but can create confusion about what applies universally versus locally—so we label everything explicitly.

#### Harbour Architecture

This harbour provides both fixed geographic constraints and dynamic resources for scientific exploration.

**Coastlines** (frameworks) define boundaries between navigable and non-navigable space—they establish what cannot be violated whilst leaving all routes within navigable waters open. Coastlines are verifiable across laboratories: all sailors encounter the same physical constraints. They don't prescribe which voyage to undertake; they define the limits within which exploration occurs.

**Winds and currents** (essays) create interpretive pull towards exploration. They reflect how particular communities understand and navigate within the space defined by coastlines. Winds vary by context and are not normative.

**Buoys** (interfaces) mark navigable channels tested by previous voyages. They show operational practices for specific contexts, but are neither unique nor mandatory routes.

This separation allows global boundary conditions to remain stable whilst local navigation practices evolve independently. Different sailors encounter the same coastlines whilst charting distinct courses suited to their vessels and destinations.

#### Local and Global Constituents

Locally, around fifteen researchers at the University of Freiburg contribute to work spanning quantum control, precision sensing, and experimental platform development. This documentation reflects our evolving practices and insights.

Globally, this work engages with broader institutional structures: university research systems, precision measurement infrastructures, international atomic physics communities, and open repositories for scientific knowledge. These global constituents provide the coordination layer—shared measurement standards, verification protocols, and knowledge commons—that enables local groups to develop compatible but distinct approaches.

All content is openly shared as living documentation, updated as experiments evolve.

### How to Navigate This Harbour

#### Document Types (organised in groups)

**Frameworks** define concepts through minimal, falsifiable conditions. They specify boundaries (what cannot be violated) without prescribing methods. These are coastlines—defining the limits of navigable space whilst allowing diverse routes within it.

**Essays** provide interpretation, motivation, and context. They reflect specific perspectives and are not normative. These are winds—generating pull towards exploration.

**Interfaces** document operational practices for specific contexts. They instantiate frameworks but are neither unique nor authoritative. These are buoys—marking navigable channels for local voyages.

#### Scope Labels (in page titles)

**(G) Global** — Applies across contexts. Should be verifiable independently of our setup.

**(L) Local** — Particular to Freiburg laboratory. Documents what we do here.

**Examples:**\
`G – Causal Clock Unification Framework` (coastline—universal boundary)\
`L – The Bias I Carry` (wind—local perspective)\
`L – Structure Your Research` (buoy—our implementation)

**Check groups for types and page titles for scope (G/L). This harbour charts coastlines that define navigable space, understands winds that motivate exploration, and marks buoys showing tested routes.**
