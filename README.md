# Welcome to the Open-Science Harbour: Ions in Freiburg

This harbour serves as a resource centre for trapped-ion quantum physics research—a place to gather frameworks, prepare for scientific exploration, and share findings. It documents both global (G) scientific principles and local (L) practices. Global content describes methods or constraints that should transfer across laboratories and research fields. Local content reflects our particular equipment, choices, and experiences at this node at the University of Freiburg. This dual scope serves complementary purposes but can create confusion about what applies universally versus locally—so we label everything explicitly.

#### What This Harbour Provides

This harbour equips sailors for scientific voyages by providing three types of resources:

**Maps of coastlines** (frameworks) document boundaries between navigable and non-navigable space. These maps chart what cannot be violated—the physical constraints all sailors encounter. Maps are verifiable: different harbours can confirm the same coastlines. They show limits without prescribing routes.

**Sails and repair kits** (essays) provide equipment that enables exploration. These tools reflect how particular communities interpret maps and undertake voyages. Equipment varies by tradition and context; sailors choose tools suited to their vessels and destinations.

**Handbooks for sailors** (interfaces) document operational practices tested in specific contexts. These guides show how previous voyages were conducted but are neither unique nor mandatory. Different crews develop different handbooks for similar waters.

This separation allows global boundary conditions (coastlines) to remain stable whilst local practices (equipment and handbooks) evolve independently. Different harbours may provide different equipment and handbooks whilst charting the same coastlines.

#### Local and Global Constituents

Locally, around fifteen researchers at the University of Freiburg contribute to work spanning quantum control, precision sensing, and experimental platform development. This documentation reflects our evolving practices and insights.

Globally, this work engages with broader institutional structures: university research systems, precision measurement infrastructures, international atomic physics communities, and open repositories for scientific knowledge. These global constituents provide the coordination layer—shared measurement standards, verification protocols, and knowledge commons—that enables local groups to develop compatible but distinct approaches.

All content is openly shared as living documentation, updated as experiments evolve.

### How to Navigate This Harbour

#### Document Types (organised in groups)

**Frameworks** define concepts through minimal, falsifiable conditions. They specify boundaries (what cannot be violated) without prescribing methods. These are maps of coastlines—charting the limits of navigable space.

**Essays** provide interpretation, motivation, and context. They reflect specific perspectives and are not normative. These are sails and repair kits—equipment enabling exploration with varied approaches.

**Interfaces** document operational practices for specific contexts. They instantiate frameworks but are neither unique nor authoritative. These are handbooks for sailors—showing tested procedures from particular crews.

#### Scope Labels (in page titles)

**(G) Global** — Applies across contexts. Should be verifiable independently of our setup.

**(L) Local** — Particular to Freiburg laboratory. Documents what we do here.

**Examples:**\
`G – Causal Clock Unification Framework` (map—universal boundary)\
`L – The Bias I Carry` (equipment—local perspective)\
`L – Structure Your Research` (handbook—our procedures)

**Check groups for document types and page titles for scope (G/L). This harbour provides maps showing boundaries, equipment enabling exploration, and handbooks documenting tested practices.**
