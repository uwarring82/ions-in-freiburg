# Welcome to the local open-science anchor: Ions in Freiburg

This site documents both global (G) principles and local (L) practices for trapped-ion quantum physics. Global content describes methods or constraints that should transfer across laboratories. Local content reflects our particular equipment, choices, and experiences at the University of Freiburg. This dual scope serves complementary purposes but can create confusion about what applies universally versus locally—so we label everything explicitly.

#### Lock-Key Open Science

This documentation applies a lock-and-key approach: **locks** are stable, falsifiable frameworks that define boundaries—they remain fixed to enable verification across groups. **Keys** are interpretive, context-specific implementations—they show how particular communities unlock and apply those frameworks. Global frameworks act as locks for scientific coordination; local practices provide keys for operational work. Neither is authoritative over the other—locks establish what must hold, keys demonstrate what can be done.

This separation allows global scientific principles to stabilize while local ion-trapping practices evolve independently. Different laboratories can verify the same framework (lock) while developing distinct implementations (keys) suited to their equipment and questions.

#### Local and Global Constituents

**Locally,** around fifteen researchers at the University of Freiburg contribute to work spanning quantum control, precision sensing, and experimental platform development. This documentation reflects our evolving practices and insights.

**Globally,** this work engages with broader institutional structures: university research systems, precision measurement infrastructures, international atomic physics communities, and open repositories for scientific knowledge. These global constituents provide the coordination layer—shared measurement standards, verification protocols, and knowledge commons—that enables local groups to develop compatible but distinct approaches.

All content is openly shared as living documentation, updated as experiments evolve.

### How to Navigate This Site

#### Scope Labels (in page titles)

**(G) Global** — Applies across contexts. Should be verifiable independently of our setup.

**(L) Local** — Particular to Freiburg laboratory. Documents what we do here.

**Examples:**\
`G – Causal Clock Unification Framework` (lock—universal boundary)\
`L – The Bias I Carry` (key—local perspective)\
`L – Trap Calibration Protocol` (key—our implementation)

#### Document Types (in headers)

**Frameworks** define concepts through minimal, falsifiable conditions. They specify boundaries (what cannot be violated) without prescribing methods. **These are locks.**

**Essays** provide interpretation, motivation, and context. They reflect specific perspectives and are not normative. **These are keys.**

**Interfaces** document operational practices for specific contexts. They instantiate frameworks but are neither unique nor authoritative. **These are also keys.**

**Check page titles for scope (G/L) and document headers for type. Locks provide stability for verification; keys provide flexibility for application.**
