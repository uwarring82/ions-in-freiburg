### Constitutional Preamble

#### Boundary and Relationship Statement

This document specifies an **invariant framework governing the conditions under which humans may legitimately claim knowledge** about any phenomenon.

It does **not** define, derive, or limit the existence of phenomena themselves.

Human knowledge about a phenomenon and the phenomenon itself are distinct domains.

* Phenomena (e.g. Ordinans) may exist independently of human observers.
* This framework constrains **human epistemic claims** about such phenomena.
* It does not describe discovery mechanisms, learning strategies, or teaching methods.

***

### 1. Scope and Non-Scope

#### 1.1 In Scope

* Necessary conditions for **epistemic legitimacy** of human claims
* Structural constraints on interpretation, framing, and meaning
* Invariant boundaries independent of tools, pedagogy, or institutions

#### 1.2 Explicitly Out of Scope

* Teaching strategies or curricula
* Learning efficiency optimisation
* Machine learning or AI as epistemic agents
* Discovery procedures or workflows
* Skill acquisition or training design

This framework remains valid even if:

* current tools disappear,
* pedagogical models change,
* institutions evolve.

***

### 2. Invariant 0 — Meaning Requires Error-Sensitive Interpretation

#### 2.1 Invariant Statement

> **Meaning does not exist in data or structure alone.**\
> **Knowledge arises only through interpretive acts performed by agents capable of recognising and responding to error.**

This is a claim about **epistemic possibility**, not about pedagogy or performance.

#### 2.2 Anthropically Bounded Scope

Invariant 0 applies **only where humans are the meaning-making agents**.\
It makes no claims about non-human systems or hypothetical autonomous discoverers.

#### 2.3 Invariant 0-F (Falsifiability)

Invariant 0 fails if any of the following are demonstrated:

1. Meaningful knowledge claims reliably emerge without interpretive acts
2. Correlation or structure alone yields warranted meaning
3. Error recognition is unnecessary for epistemic improvement

***

### 3. Derived Epistemic Constraint — The DEEP Partition

#### 3.1 DEEP as Epistemic Partition (Not a Method)

DEEP names a **partition of epistemic responsibility**, derived from Invariant 0.

| Partition | Epistemic role                     | Delegability    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Deposit   | World → traces                     | Delegable       |
| Extract   | Framing, relevance, representation | ❌ Non-delegable |
| Process   | Correlation ordering               | Delegable       |
| Elevate   | Claims, non-claims, interpretation | ❌ Non-delegable |

DEEP does **not** describe how learning happens.\
It constrains **what counts as a legitimate knowledge claim**.

#### 3.2 Tool–Extract Coupling (Clarification)

Tool availability may inform Extract decisions (practical constraints),\
but **cannot replace the human act of framing**.

Epistemic responsibility for Extract and Elevate remains human.

#### 3.3 Article 1-F (Falsifiability)

DEEP fails if:

* Extract or Elevate are implicit or absent,
* tools are treated as epistemic agents,
* claims are elevated without explicit non-claims.

***

### 4. Asymmetric Architecture

#### 4.1 One-Way Constraint Principle

This framework constrains **human claims about phenomena**.\
It does not constrain phenomena themselves.

No statement may:

* derive phenomena from learning,
* make existence contingent on discovery,
* collapse ontology into epistemology.

#### 4.2 Non-Merge Rule

This framework must remain distinct from:

* discovery frameworks,
* physical theories,
* sociological analyses of science.

Any merger constitutes a category error.

***

### 5. Falsifiability and Failure (Invariant Level)

#### 5.1 Structural Failure Modes

The framework fails if:

* interpretation is hidden inside tools,
* meaning is inferred from metrics alone,
* success narratives omit failure conditions.

#### 5.2 Meta-Falsification (Article M)

This framework fails if, in practice:

1. DEEP becomes rhetorical rather than enforced
2. Anthropomorphic language is tolerated
3. Epistemic legitimacy is replaced by performance metrics

These are observable social and institutional indicators.

***

### 6. Boundary Stress Test (Acid Test)

A discovery may be ontologically valid\
while a human claim about it is epistemically invalid.

Acceptance of discovery does **not** imply acceptance of claims.

This separation is intentional and necessary.

(See linked Acid Test example in invariant artefacts.)

***

### 7. Violation Mirror (Audit Function)

Any of the following invalidate a claim unless explicitly corrected:

* “The model learned / understood / discovered the physics”
* Extract or Elevate steps omitted
* Accuracy presented as epistemic warrant
* Bidirectional arrows between learning and existence

This list is **sufficient**, not exhaustive.

***

### 8. Cross-Framework Protocol

#### 8.1 Permitted References

* Discovery frameworks may note that human claims are constrained here.
* This framework may reference discoveries as worked examples.

#### 8.2 Forbidden Couplings

* No derivation of phenomena from learning principles
* No learning framework defining existence conditions

***

### 9. Status of This Document

This is a **map of coastlines**, not a handbook for sailors.

Downstream documents (handbooks, curricula, protocols) must:

* cite this framework,
* remain falsifiable against it,
* accept invalidation by it.

**Archivist note:**\
References anchor domains where the invariant is already implicit.\
They are **not prerequisites** for using the framework.

### Constitutional Lock Statement

> The Human Learning Framework specifies **necessary conditions for epistemic legitimacy**, not sufficient conditions for learning success.
