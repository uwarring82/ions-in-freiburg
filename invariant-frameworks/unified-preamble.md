### Harbour Integration

This preamble operates as **Tier -1 Constitutional Law** relative to the Open-Science Harbour's tiered scaffold:

<table><thead><tr><th width="173.9375">Tier</th><th>Domain</th><th>Governed By</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>-1 (Constitutional)</strong></td><td>Framework-framework relations</td><td>This Preamble: Non-Merge Rule, Coupling Protocol, Acid Test</td></tr><tr><td><strong>0 (Causal)</strong></td><td>Model-phenomena relations</td><td>Harbour causal boundary conditions (L_comparison ≤ cτ)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1a (Lamport)</strong></td><td>Event ordering</td><td>Logical clocks, happens-before relations</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1b (Metrological)</strong></td><td>Physical clocks</td><td>SI second, frequency standards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2a (Calendar)</strong></td><td>Coordination systems</td><td>UTC, civil time, scheduling</td></tr></tbody></table>

This preamble enforces the Endorsement Marker requirement established in Resolution R-O/L-01. The "Local candidate framework (no parity implied)" language from that resolution represents the permissive counterpart to this preamble's restrictive architecture.

No downstream document may claim broader endorsement scope than this preamble permits.

***

### Purpose

This preamble establishes the constitutional architecture governing the relationship between frameworks that describe _how we model phenomena_ (descriptive/discovery frameworks) and frameworks that constrain _what humans may legitimately claim to know_ (epistemic frameworks).

It operates under a strict **map-only epistemology**: we deal only in representations, never in claims about territory itself.

This document must be prefixed to, or cited by, any Council-ratified framework operating in either domain.

***

### The Foundational Commitment: Agnosticism About Territory

#### The Structural Bound

Humans are irreducibly bounded by embodied perception, evolved cognitive priors, language and symbol systems, and historically contingent scientific practices. This is not merely a practical limitation but a structural one. Any framework we propose is necessarily mediated by representation.

**Consequence:** No framework governed by human representation licenses claims to a final, observer-independent ontology. We therefore make no such claims and commit only to disciplined model-building.

_Note:_ This is a methodological stance about what frameworks can license, not a metaphysical assertion about what is or is not accessible "in principle."

#### What Remains Accessible

Despite this bound, science has repeatedly uncovered structures that are remarkably stable across perspectives. The productive move is to stop asking "What is reality made of?" and instead ask: "Which structures remain invariant under changes of description, scale, and observer?"

These invariants function as **selection constraints on viable representations**, not as properties attributed to territory. Whatever models we build must preserve these invariants to remain viable. This is the only tractable question.

***

### The Two Domains

#### Domain Definitions

| Domain          | Question                                                          | Example Frameworks                                           | Jurisdiction                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Descriptive** | How do we model phenomena? What structures survive interrogation? | Discovery frameworks, physical models, measurement protocols | Model structure, invariants, comparison geometry |
| **Epistemic**   | What may humans legitimately claim to know?                       | Human Learning Framework, warrant criteria                   | Claims, warrant, justification                   |

These domains are **categorically distinct**. Neither derives from, reduces to, nor determines the other.

_Clarification:_ Distinctness here forbids derivation or reduction, not mutual historical influence. Epistemology may be informed by descriptive success; description may be shaped by epistemic practices. What is forbidden is collapsing one into the other or treating either as foundational for the other.

#### The Asymmetric Dependency

Epistemic frameworks constrain human claims **about** descriptive matters. Descriptive frameworks are **not constrained by** how humans learn.

```

A phenomenon may provide "resistance" without any human modelling it. A human claim about a phenomenon may be epistemically illegitimate even if the model is internally coherent.

**This asymmetry is non-negotiable.**

***

### The Non-Merge Rule

#### Statement

No Council-ratified document may:

1. **Derive phenomena from learning** — assert that something exists _because_ humans discovered it
2. **Make model validity contingent on discovery** — imply that successful modelling requires human observation
3. **Collapse description into epistemology** — treat "how we model" and "what we know" as the same question
4. **Collapse epistemology into description** — treat "what we know" as directly determined by model structure without interpretive mediation
5. **Make territory claims** — assert what reality "is" rather than what viable models preserve

#### Forbidden Coupling Patterns

The following syntactic forms violate the Non-Merge Rule regardless of apparent plausibility:

| Pattern                     | Example                                                               | Why Forbidden                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Analogical derivation**   | "X is like Y in structure, therefore X shares Y's ontological status" | Structure similarity does not license existence claims |
| **Constraint mirroring**    | "Because epistemology has limit L, phenomena must also have limit L"  | Epistemic bounds do not constrain territory            |
| **Discovery → existence**   | "If a model is successfully learned, its posits exist"                | Learnability does not entail existence                 |
| **Existence → knowledge**   | "If X exists, we can in principle know it"                            | Existence does not guarantee epistemic access          |
| **Reduction by definition** | "Knowledge just _is_ reliable model-tracking"                         | Conflates distinct categories by fiat                  |

#### Enforcement

Any statement matching a forbidden pattern constitutes a **category error** and invalidates the document section containing it.

The Guardian stance holds veto power over merge violations. Citation: _Violation of Clarity or Ethics_ (Category Error subtype).

***

### "Resistance" as Operational Postulate

Both domains presuppose that **models can fail** and **interpretations can be erroneous**. Revision is forced by something other than preference.

We treat this as an **operational postulate**, not a metaphysical discovery:

> **The Resistance Postulate:** Violation of invariants produces non-viable models. No claim is made about the source of this constraint; we model only the failure pattern itself.

This postulate:

* Preserves normativity (models can be wrong)
* Preserves discipline (not "anything goes")
* Makes no territory claims (what "resists" is unspecified)

The word "resistance" is a **heuristic marker**, not a metaphysical term. It names the operational fact that some models fail without asserting what causes failure.

***

### Framework Evaluation: Meta-Criteria

Since direct access to territory is blocked, evaluation must be indirect. Frameworks are judged by **model-selection criteria**, not by correspondence to "reality."

#### The Five Criteria

| Criterion                         | Question                                                                          | Weight            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Invariance Robustness**         | Does the framework preserve known symmetries and invariants across viable models? | Absolute veto     |
| **Compression**                   | Does it reduce independent assumptions? (Kolmogorov-style economy)                | Strong preference |
| **Cross-Domain Fertility**        | Does it generate insight across otherwise disconnected domains?                   | Exploratory       |
| **Stability Under Theory Change** | Does it survive or gracefully adapt when models are replaced?                     | Strong preference |
| **Explicit Boundary Conditions**  | Does it clearly state where it does not apply?                                    | Conditional veto  |

#### Veto Logic and Conflict Resolution

**Invariance Robustness** is an absolute veto: a framework that violates known invariants is rejected regardless of other merits.

**Explicit Boundary Conditions** is a conditional veto with two satisfaction paths:

1. **Path A (Full compliance):** Framework documents explicit boundaries — passes veto
2. **Path B (Provisional status):** Framework explicitly flags as boundary-agnostic, accepts restricted jurisdiction, and is marked "Provisional" in all citations — passes veto conditionally

This prevents premature rejection of nascent but invariant-preserving frameworks while maintaining boundary discipline.

#### Criterion Conflicts

When criteria pull in opposite directions (e.g., Fertility vs. Boundaries):

1. Absolute veto criteria override all others
2. Conditional veto criteria must be satisfied via Path A or Path B
3. Strong preference criteria guide selection among passing candidates
4. Exploratory criteria inform research direction, not ratification

***

### The Stress-Test Protocol

#### Purpose

Frameworks must be deliberately pushed into their breakdown zones. The manner of failure — graceful degradation versus conceptual collapse — reveals structural depth.

#### Key Terms

> **Glossary for Non-Specialists**

<table><thead><tr><th width="209.609375">Term</th><th>Plain-Language Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>η (eta)</strong></td><td><em>Causal efficiency</em> — a dimensionless ratio measuring how much of the available causal "budget" (lightspeed × time) is used for comparison. η = 1 means the comparison uses the full budget; η → 0 means the comparison geometry is collapsing toward the causal boundary.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>L_comparison</strong></td><td>The spatial separation over which a comparison (measurement, synchronisation, signal exchange) actually occurs. Must satisfy L_comparison ≤ cτ, where c is lightspeed and τ is the available time.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Comparison geometry</strong></td><td>The spatial and temporal arrangement of source, apparatus, and comparison events. When η → 0, this geometry "collapses" — there is no longer enough causal budget to complete the comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Causal boundary</strong></td><td>The limit L_comparison = cτ, beyond which no comparison is physically possible. This is not a metaphysical claim but an operational constraint on all measurement and coordination.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Required Stress Tests

Before Council ratification, any descriptive framework must document behaviour under:

1. **Scale extremes** — Does the framework degrade gracefully at ultra-high energy, ultra-low temperature, or cosmological scales?
2. **Boundary approach** — For frameworks involving the causal boundary L\_comparison = cτ, what happens as η → 0?
3. **Interpretive plurality** — Does the framework remain coherent under multiple viable interpretations, or does it secretly commit to one?
4. **Domain export** — When applied outside declared jurisdiction, does it fail explicitly or produce spurious results?

#### Mandatory η-Regime Test

**Any framework invoking causal efficiency η must document failure mode at η → 0 as a veto-level stress test.**

This is non-negotiable. The η → 0 regime is where "sails lose wind" — the causal boundary where comparison geometry collapses. Frameworks that do not explicitly characterise this regime cannot be ratified.

#### Failure Classification

| Failure Mode             | Interpretation                             | Action                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graceful degradation** | Framework has depth; boundaries are real   | Document η-regime behaviour; proceed to ratification  |
| **Conceptual collapse**  | Framework is scaffolding, not structure    | Restrict jurisdiction; flag as provisional            |
| **Silent failure**       | Framework produces results without warning | **Reject** — requires explicit boundary documentation |

Silent failure is an automatic rejection criterion.

***

### Pluralism, Underdetermination, and Capture Prevention

#### Distinguishing Two Issues

**Underdetermination**: Multiple frameworks are observationally equivalent given current evidence. This does not entail that all are "equally real" — it may simply indicate that the interpretive layer is extraneous scaffolding.

**Genuine pluralism**: Multiple frameworks offer genuinely different structural commitments that survive stress-testing and satisfy meta-criteria. These are maintained as live options.

The distinction matters: underdetermination calls for further constraint; pluralism calls for parallel development.

#### Capture Prevention

Maintaining multiple viable frameworks is a **systemic safeguard** against epistemic capture, where a single model locks inquiry into a dead-end trajectory. This is a feature, not a bug.

The architecture prevents capture by:

1. **Silo enforcement** — frameworks cannot import invariants without explicit justification
2. **Independent revision** — each framework evolves under its own falsification conditions
3. **Explicit endorsement scope** — local frameworks do not claim broad authority
4. **Provisional status path** — nascent frameworks can develop without premature commitment

***

### Framework Coupling Protocol

#### Permitted References

| From                    | To                            | Permitted Reference Type                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Epistemic → Descriptive | Worked examples, case studies | "Discovery X illustrates warrant structure..."                       |
| Descriptive → Epistemic | Constraint acknowledgment     | "Human claims about model X are subject to \[Learning Framework]..." |

#### Forbidden Couplings

| Coupling Type         | Example Violation                                                | Why Forbidden                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Derivation            | "The framework implies phenomenon X exists"                      | Models cannot generate territory       |
| Contingency           | "X exists only if discoverable"                                  | "Resistance" is not observer-dependent |
| Bidirectional arrows  | "Learning ↔ Existence"                                           | Violates asymmetric architecture       |
| Definitional merger   | "Knowledge _is_ model-tracking"                                  | Conflates distinct domains             |
| Territory assertion   | "Reality is relational structure"                                | Makes metaphysical claim               |
| Analogical derivation | "Learning has structure S; therefore phenomena have structure S" | Matches forbidden pattern              |

***

### Silo Enforcement

#### Independent Revision

Each framework may be revised independently, provided:

1. The revision does not violate the Non-Merge Rule
2. The revision does not create circular dependencies
3. The revision is ratified by Council under its own falsification conditions
4. The revision passes all stress tests at veto level

#### Cross-Domain Discipline

Frameworks in different domains must not:

* **Presume identity of invariants** or import them without explicit justification citing this preamble's coupling protocol
* **Share falsification conditions** (what falsifies a descriptive claim differs from what falsifies an epistemic claim)
* **Share jurisdiction** (no framework may define validity conditions outside its declared stack position)

_Note:_ This rule forbids _unjustified_ cross-domain import, not all cross-domain reference. If a future result (e.g., causal-learning convergence theorems) genuinely bridges domains, it may be incorporated via explicit Council review under the coupling protocol. The burden of justification lies with the importer.

***

### Acid Test for Preamble Compliance

Any Council-ratified document passes the Acid Test if:

1. **Asymmetry preserved** — The document does not imply that phenomena depend on human knowledge
2. **Non-Merge respected** — No statement matches any forbidden coupling pattern
3. **Map-only language** — No claims about "what reality is"; only about model viability
4. **Stack position clear** — The document explicitly states its tier
5. **Coupling protocol followed** — References to other frameworks use permitted types only
6. **Silo integrity maintained** — The document does not import invariants without explicit justification
7. **Meta-criteria satisfied** — Veto-level criteria (invariance, boundaries) are documented or provisional status declared
8. **Stress tests passed** — Failure modes are classified and boundary behaviour documented
9. **η-regime documented** — For causal-efficiency frameworks, η → 0 behaviour is explicit

A document failing any condition requires revision before ratification.

***

### Constitutional Lock

This preamble is **frozen** upon Council ratification.

Revision requires:

1. Unanimous Council consent
2. Explicit demonstration that current architecture is falsified or incoherent
3. Proposed replacement that satisfies all existing compliance tests

No downstream document may override, amend, or reinterpret this preamble.

### Appendix A: ADM Lens Integration

The three-lens decomposition clarifies how this architecture operates:

#### Analog Lens (The Coastline)

The unmediated "resistance" that phenomena provide. We do not design the coastline; we design the hull (apparatus) and sails (models) to navigate it. The structural bound is simply the point where analog signal exceeds digital resolution.

_Note:_ "Resistance" and "coastline" are heuristic markers. They name operational constraints without asserting what provides them.

#### Digital Lens (The Sails)

Symbolic abstractions — Lorentz invariance, gauge symmetries, causal boundary conditions — that we project onto the analog coastline. These are functional tools that capture "wind" to generate motion (predictive power). Pluralism is necessary because different conditions require different sail configurations.

#### Memory Lens (The Repair Kit)

Stability across theory change. If a structure survives the transition from one model to another, it represents a fixed point in our collective interaction with the coastline. The causal boundary condition L\_comparison ≤ cτ is a Memory-class invariant: it constrains all possible comparison geometries regardless of model specifics.

***

### Appendix B: Worked Examples

#### Compliant Statement (Descriptive Framework)

> "The Ordinans framework models emergent order in physical systems. Human claims about Ordinans models are subject to the Human Learning Framework (v2.1)."

**Analysis:** Correctly describes model scope without asserting what exists. Acknowledges epistemic constraint.

#### Compliant Statement (Epistemic Framework)

> "The model is internally coherent (descriptive validity). The claim 'we know the structure because the network identified it' requires warrant documentation (epistemic legitimacy)."

**Analysis:** Correctly separates model coherence from warranted claim.

#### Compliant Statement (Invariants)

> "Relational invariants appear in all viable models. The framework does not license claims about entities beyond these invariants."

**Analysis:** Jurisdictional language. States what the framework permits, not what exists.

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "The Ordinans exists because humans can learn to recognise it."

**Analysis:** Matches forbidden pattern (Discovery → existence). Violates Non-Merge Rule. **Rejected.**

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "Reality is relational structure rather than underlying stuff."

**Analysis:** Makes metaphysical territory claim. Violates map-only commitment. **Rejected.**

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "Whatever reality is, it must support these invariants."

**Analysis:** Covert territory claim via modal language. Violates map-only commitment. **Rejected.** Compliant alternative: "Whatever models we build must preserve these invariants to remain viable."

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "Because human cognition has computational limits, physical systems must also have computational limits."

**Analysis:** Matches forbidden pattern (Constraint mirroring). Epistemic bounds do not constrain territory. **Rejected.**

### Appendix C: Stress-Test Template

For each framework submitted for ratification:

| Test Domain               | Behaviour Observed | Failure Mode | Action Required |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Scale extreme (high)      |                    |              |                 |
| Scale extreme (low)       |                    |              |                 |
| Boundary approach (η → 0) |                    |              |                 |
| Interpretive plurality    |                    |              |                 |
| Domain export             |                    |              |                 |

**Classification:**

* \[ ] Graceful degradation — proceed to ratification
* \[ ] Conceptual collapse — restrict jurisdiction, flag provisional
* \[ ] Silent failure — **reject**, require boundary documentation

#### Scout Checklist (ADM-EC Protocol)

All stress-tests and meta-criteria audits shall be conducted under Scout protocol: scanning for occlusion, reframing needs, and unasked questions without synthesis or decision authority.

| Check                                                         | Status | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| ⚠ Horizon signal detected? (emerging invariants, blind spots) |        |       |
| Occlusion flagged? (hidden assumptions, unexamined priors)    |        |       |
| Reframe needed? (category error risk, coupling violation)     |        |       |
| Uncertainty explicit? (η-regime, boundary-agnostic status)    |        |       |

**If all checks negative:** Horizon clear — proceed to Council vote.

**If any check positive:** Flag for targeted re-deliberation before ratification.

| NM-06      | Modal territory claim     | "Reality _must_ have property P"                       | Modal claims about territory forbidden |
| NM-07      | Implicit bidirectionality | "Learning and existence are mutually constraining"     | Asymmetry violation                    |

**Usage:** When reviewing documents, scan for pattern matches. Any match triggers Guardian review and potential veto.

### Appendix E: Constitutional Summary

**For new participants — one page, five commitments.**

***

#### The Harbour Constitutional Architecture in Brief

This preamble governs all frameworks in the Open-Science Harbour. It enforces five core commitments:

***

**1. Map-Only Epistemology**

We build models; we do not claim to know "what reality is."

> **Compliant:** "Viable models preserve Lorentz invariance." **Non-compliant:** "Reality is Lorentz-invariant."

***

**2. The Non-Merge Rule**

Description (how we model) and epistemology (what we may claim to know) are separate domains. Neither derives from the other.

> **Compliant:** "Human claims about this model require warrant documentation." **Non-compliant:** "This phenomenon exists because we discovered it."

***

**3. Asymmetric Stack**

Epistemic frameworks constrain claims _about_ descriptive frameworks. Descriptive frameworks are not constrained by how humans learn.

```
Phenomena → Descriptive Frameworks → Epistemic Frameworks → Claims → Tools
            (models)                 (warrant)              (outputs)
```

Arrows point one way only.

***

**4. Invariance-First Evaluation**

Frameworks are judged by whether they preserve known invariants, not by whether they "correspond to reality."

> **Veto-level test:** Does the framework violate Lorentz invariance, gauge symmetry, or the causal boundary L\_comparison ≤ cτ? If yes, reject.

***

**5. Stress-Test Before Ratification**

Every framework must document how it fails at its boundaries. Silent failure = automatic rejection.

> **Key question:** What happens as η → 0 (causal efficiency approaches zero)?

#### Acid Test Results

<table><thead><tr><th width="252.96875">Test</th><th width="105.05078125">Result</th><th>Evidence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1. Asymmetry preserved</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>Framework treats LLM outputs as tools subject to human warrant, not as sources of knowledge claims. No implication that phenomena depend on human learning.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Non-Merge respected</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>Clear separation between "what the LLM generates" (descriptive) and "what the learner may legitimately claim" (epistemic). No forbidden patterns detected.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Map-only language</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>Framework uses jurisdictional language throughout: "The framework does not license..." rather than "Reality is..."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Stack position clear</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>Explicitly positioned at EPISTEMIC tier with TOOLS interface. Citation format compliant.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Coupling protocol followed</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>References to descriptive frameworks (e.g., information theory, cognitive science) are constraint acknowledgments, not derivations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. Silo integrity maintained</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>No invariants imported from descriptive domain without justification. MSG provenance notation is epistemic-native.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>7. Meta-criteria satisfied</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>Invariance: preserves DEEP partition structure. Boundaries: explicit scope (foundational education, not expert practice).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8. Stress tests passed</strong></td><td>✅ Pass</td><td>See below.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9. η-regime documented</strong></td><td>⚠️ N/A</td><td>Framework does not invoke causal efficiency η directly; no η-regime test required.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Stress-Test Results

| Test Domain                | Behaviour Observed                                                                                            | Failure Mode     | Action                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Scale extreme (high)**   | Framework scales to large learner populations without structural change                                       | Graceful         | None required                 |
| **Scale extreme (low)**    | Framework applies to individual learners; no minimum population assumed                                       | Graceful         | None required                 |
| **Boundary approach**      | At boundary of "foundational" vs. "expert" learning, framework explicitly defers to domain-specific protocols | Graceful         | Boundary documented in §Scope |
| **Interpretive plurality** | Framework-agnostic about LLM architecture; works with any generative model meeting MSG compliance             | Graceful         | No hidden commitment detected |
| **Domain export**          | When applied outside education (e.g., to professional research), framework warns of jurisdiction limits       | Explicit failure | Correct behaviour             |

**Classification:** Graceful degradation across all tests.
