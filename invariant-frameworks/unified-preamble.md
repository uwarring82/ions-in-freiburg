### Purpose

This preamble establishes the **constitutional architecture** governing the relationship between frameworks that describe _what exists_ (ontological/discovery frameworks) and frameworks that constrain _what humans may legitimately claim to know_ (epistemic frameworks).

It must be prefixed to, or cited by, any Council-ratified framework operating in either domain.

***

### The Fundamental Distinction

#### Two Domains, One Architecture

| Domain          | Question                                    | Example Frameworks                                 | Jurisdiction                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Ontological** | What exists? What are its properties?       | Discovery frameworks, physical theories, metrology | Phenomena, structures, causal relations |
| **Epistemic**   | What may humans legitimately claim to know? | Human Learning Framework                           | Claims, warrant, justification          |

These domains are **categorically distinct**. Neither derives from, reduces to, nor determines the other.

#### The Asymmetric Dependency

Epistemic frameworks constrain human claims **about** ontological matters.\
Ontological frameworks are **not constrained by** how humans learn.

```
[ Phenomena ]
     ↑
     │  (no upward constraint)
     │
[ Epistemic Framework ]
     │
     │  (downward constraint on claims)
     ↓
[ Human Knowledge Claims ]
```

A phenomenon may exist without any human knowing it.\
A human claim about a phenomenon may be epistemically illegitimate even if the phenomenon exists.

**This asymmetry is non-negotiable.**

***

### The Non-Merge Rule

#### Statement

No Council-ratified document may:

1. **Derive phenomena from learning** — assert that something exists _because_ humans discovered it
2. **Make existence contingent on discovery** — imply that phenomena require human observation to be real
3. **Collapse ontology into epistemology** — treat "what exists" and "what we know" as the same question
4. **Collapse epistemology into ontology** — treat "what we know" as directly determined by "what exists" without interpretive mediation

#### Enforcement

Any statement violating the Non-Merge Rule constitutes a **category error** and invalidates the document section containing it.

The Guardian stance holds veto power over merge violations.\
Citation: _Violation of Clarity or Ethics_ (Category Error subtype).

***

### Framework Coupling Protocol

#### Permitted References

| From                    | To                            | Permitted Reference Type                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Epistemic → Ontological | Worked examples, case studies | "Discovery X illustrates DEEP partition..."                    |
| Ontological → Epistemic | Constraint acknowledgment     | "Human claims about X are subject to \[Learning Framework]..." |

#### Forbidden Couplings

| Coupling Type        | Example Violation                           | Why Forbidden                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Derivation           | "The framework implies phenomenon X exists" | Epistemology cannot generate ontology |
| Contingency          | "X exists only if discoverable"             | Existence is not observer-dependent   |
| Bidirectional arrows | "Learning ↔ Existence"                      | Violates asymmetric architecture      |
| Definitional merger  | "Knowledge _is_ truth-tracking"             | Conflates distinct domains            |

### The Stack

Council-ratified frameworks form a non-circular stack:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PHENOMENA (World)                   │
│   Ordinans, clocks, physical systems, etc.  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↑
                    │ (no upward constraint)
                    │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     ONTOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS                  │
│   Discovery frameworks, physical theories   │
│   Describe what exists and its properties   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↑
                    │ (no upward constraint)
                    │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORKS                    │
│   Human Learning Framework                  │
│   Constrain legitimate knowledge claims     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    │ (downward constraint)
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     HUMAN KNOWLEDGE CLAIMS                  │
│   Papers, reports, assertions, beliefs      │
│   Subject to DEEP partition audit           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    │ (operational constraint)
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     TOOLS, METHODS, CURRICULA               │
│   Handbooks, protocols, teaching materials  │
│   Must cite and comply with frameworks      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key property:** Arrows point downward only. No layer constrains the layer above it.

### Silo Enforcement

#### Independent Revision

Each framework may be revised independently, provided:

1. The revision does not violate the Non-Merge Rule
2. The revision does not create circular dependencies
3. The revision is ratified by Council under its own falsification conditions

#### No Cross-Contamination

Frameworks in different domains must not:

* Share invariants (each domain has its own foundational claims)
* Share falsification conditions (what falsifies an ontological claim differs from what falsifies an epistemic claim)
* Share governance (the Guardian governs epistemic clarity; the Architect governs structural coherence; neither governs the other's domain exclusively)

***

### Resistance of Reality

Both domains presuppose that **reality provides normative constraint**.

* Ontological frameworks: Reality determines which descriptions are accurate
* Epistemic frameworks: Reality determines which interpretations are erroneous

This shared presupposition does **not** merge the domains. It establishes a common external constraint that prevents both:

* Ontological frameworks from becoming arbitrary invention
* Epistemic frameworks from becoming arbitrary interpretation

The metaphysics of this constraint is not specified. The architecture requires only that _something_ makes some claims wrong.

***

### Acid Test for Preamble Compliance

Any Council-ratified document passes the Acid Test if:

1. **Asymmetry preserved:** The document does not imply that phenomena depend on human knowledge
2. **Non-Merge respected:** No statement derives existence from discovery or vice versa
3. **Stack position clear:** The document explicitly states its layer in the stack
4. **Coupling protocol followed:** References to other frameworks use permitted types only
5. **Silo integrity maintained:** The document does not import invariants from other domains

A document failing any condition requires revision before ratification.

***

### Constitutional Lock

This preamble is **frozen** upon Council ratification.

Revision requires:

1. Unanimous Council consent
2. Explicit demonstration that current architecture is falsified or incoherent
3. Proposed replacement that satisfies all existing compliance tests

No downstream document may override, amend, or reinterpret this preamble.

### Appendix: Worked Example

#### Compliant Statement (Ontological Framework)

> "The Ordinans framework describes emergent order in physical systems. Human claims about Ordinans phenomena are subject to the Human Learning Framework (v2.1)."

**Analysis:** Correctly acknowledges epistemic constraint without deriving Ordinans from human learning.

#### Compliant Statement (Epistemic Framework)

> "The protein structure exists (ontological validity). The claim 'we know the structure because the network identified it' requires DEEP documentation (epistemic legitimacy)."

**Analysis:** Correctly separates existence from warranted claim.

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "The Ordinans exists because humans can learn to recognise it."

**Analysis:** Derives existence from learnability. Violates Non-Merge Rule. **Rejected.**

#### Non-Compliant Statement

> "Knowledge is whatever reliably tracks truth, so the Learning Framework reduces to reliabilism."

**Analysis:** Attempts definitional merger. Conflates distinct epistemic positions. **Rejected.**
