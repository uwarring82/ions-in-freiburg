## The Myth of the Heroic Teacher

As a physicist contributing to teaching—and often mediating between professors, tutors, and students—I am aware that learners primarily encounter the professional habits and disciplinary practices I have developed within the university setting. They see the institutional patterns I work within and reproduce, including the fact that I do not execute them perfectly; like any instructor, I make mistakes, sometimes more often than I realise in the moment. Yet far more of their learning is shaped by the wider system around us: schedules, administrative interfaces, assessment regimes, resource constraints, and now rapidly evolving artificial intelligence tools. Much of what determines the quality and reliability of teaching lies outside the control of any single instructor.

We all recognise the pattern. The colleague who answers emails at midnight. The lecturer who rewrites a course because regulations shifted. The lab supervisor who keeps an experiment alive by improvising repairs. We admire this commitment. We call it dedication. And we are right to do so: heroism inspires. Heroes give us stories, and stories transmit ideals across generations. The teacher who goes beyond the call of duty becomes a model, a proof that excellence is possible, a figure who shapes how we imagine the profession at its best.

But beneath this admiration sits an uncomfortable truth: _if our teaching depends on individual heroism, it is structurally designed to fail._ There is a difference between _celebrating_ heroism and _requiring_ it. A system that honours its dedicated teachers while ensuring that ordinary, sustainable effort suffices for good teaching—that is a system worth building. Universities are systems, not stages. Teaching is architecture, not performance. And if we want to understand why education often feels fragile, inequitable, or exhausting, we must stop asking how to produce better heroes and start asking how to build better systems.

## A German Beginning: Between Humboldt and Bologna

The German conversation about teaching often begins with Wilhelm von Humboldt. His 1809–1810 reforms articulated two enduring ideas: _Einheit von Forschung und Lehre_—the unity of research and teaching—and _Lernfreiheit_—the student's freedom to chart their own educational path. Behind these stands the broader tradition of _Bildung_: education as the cultivation of autonomy, depth, and judgment. Modern _Didaktik_, especially in the work of Wolfgang Klafki, frames teachers not as implementers of pre-written curricula but as designers who interpret content according to its _Bildungsgehalt_—its intrinsic educational substance. Westbury, Hopmann, and Riquarts emphasise this autonomy: teachers are expected to justify why they choose particular approaches, not merely how they perform in the classroom.

But today's universities also sit under the strong influence of the Bologna Process, accreditation regimes, and output-driven quality assurance. Learning outcomes, rubrics, and key performance indicators now shape much of the institutional landscape. Thus higher education lives between two poles: Humboldtian autonomy and Bologna-driven standardisation. Neither alone is sufficient. One offers depth without structure; the other structure without depth. The task is to build systems that honour both.

## The Heroism Trap: A Thermodynamics of Teaching

Physics offers a blunt diagnostic: a system that requires continuous external energy injection to maintain order is thermodynamically unstable. Higher education increasingly resembles such a system. When teaching quality depends on unpaid emotional labour, administrative firefighting, and personal improvisation, we are not witnessing noble dedication—we are witnessing structural dissipation. A well-designed system should require minimal maintenance energy so that the limited free energy instructors do have can be invested in what cannot be automated: presence, clarity, dialogue, mentorship.

Burnout is not a personal failure; it is a measurement of systemic entropy. Research across tens of thousands of academics identifies the same drivers: excessive workload, weak institutional support, administrative friction, emotional labour. Teaching remains undervalued because research is easier to count. Heroism is admirable. A system that requires it is not—and cannot be sustained by asking individuals to compensate for structural failures indefinitely.

## The External Load Problem

Even the best classroom system does not operate in isolation. Students and faculty alike live in an external field shaped by economic pressure, precarious housing, care obligations, digital overload, and the expectation to be constantly reachable. These forces distort attention, time, and well-being. This is not about moral weakness or 'poor prioritisation.' It is about physics: when constant external load acts on a system, trajectories diverge from idealised paths, no matter how strong the internal design. A system that recognises external load does not lower standards. It removes avoidable friction, offers predictable structure, and creates buffers that make high standards realistically attainable.

## Trust Is Not Merely a Feeling. It Is an Infrastructure.

Self-Determination Theory, developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, identifies three basic psychological needs: _autonomy_—a sense of volition; _competence_—feeling capable; and _relatedness_—meaningful connection. These needs apply to teachers as much as to students. When faculty autonomy is restricted, or when they are overloaded and isolated, they tend—often unconsciously—to adopt more controlling teaching practices.

This reframes the triad that anchors this essay. _Respect_ becomes structural fairness; _trust_ becomes system reliability; _responsibility_ becomes emergent autonomy. Trust is not primarily an emotion. It is the emergent property of transparent, predictable, consistently applied systems. When processes are unstable, trust decays—regardless of individual good intentions. When systems are clear, fair, and reliable, trust can emerge even in large and impersonal settings.

## The Hidden Curriculum: A Signal-to-Noise Problem

Rachel Gable's work on the hidden curriculum shows that first-generation students often misattribute systemic opacity to personal deficiency. From a physics perspective, this is a signal-to-noise problem. Students unfamiliar with implicit expectations must expend enormous cognitive energy decoding social and institutional noise. Assessment under such conditions becomes equivalent to measuring a weak signal with an uncalibrated detector—you measure cultural capital, not mastery.

The Transparency in Learning and Teaching framework, developed by Mary-Ann Winkelmes and colleagues, acts as a calibration protocol. By making purpose, task, and criteria for success explicit, it reduces noise. Lower noise expresses respect. Respect conditions trust. Trust enables responsibility. Clean signals improve measurement.

\[FIGURE 2: Learning as Signal Detection]

## Artificial Intelligence as a Stress Test for Trust

Generative artificial intelligence has exposed how fragile trust infrastructures really are. Students use these tools extensively; detection tools are inaccurate and inequitable; policies lag behind technology. This produces an adversarial dynamic: students fear being wrongly accused, faculty fear being deceived. To avoid escalation, a systemic approach is needed.

One model is a Safe Harbor Protocol: version-controlled drafts (a 'commit history' for writing); tiered disclosure of artificial intelligence use; a first-time non-punitive disclosure window; assessment that weights process over product; clear, proportionate consequences for deliberate violations; and a small academic integrity panel for escalation and adjudication. A trust-based protocol still requires clear boundaries. After the non-punitive window, undisclosed content generation without reasoning disclosure triggers a proportionate review process—not punitive by default, but reflective and documented. Disputes should be adjudicated by a small, trained academic integrity panel rather than a single instructor, ensuring procedural fairness and avoiding adversarial escalation.

Such systems treat artificial intelligence not as an enemy but as a transparent part of the ecosystem. When the environment supports honesty, honesty becomes safe.

## What Systems Cannot (and Should Not) Do

Critics often ask whether teaching can truly be systematised when education is, at its core, a human relationship. Nel Noddings reminds us that care—the attentive presence of one person to another—cannot be mechanised, automated, or written into a rubric. It is relational, moral, human. But systems thinking does not aim to replace care. It aims to protect space for care. Without structural support—without clear processes, predictable workloads, transparent expectations—teachers' free cognitive energy is consumed by friction, leaving little room for genuine contact with students. Systems cannot create care. They can create the conditions under which care becomes possible.

Trust-based systems are not naïve systems. They make honesty safe, but they also maintain proportionate consequences for repeated or deliberate violations. Trust is extended generously; responsibility is expected reciprocally.

## Respect, Trust, Responsibility — as Design Specifications

Reframed as parameters, the triad reveals unexpected precision. Structural respect equals signal clarity: transparent criteria, predictable timelines, calibrated assignments, accessible appeal pathways. Institutional trust equals system reliability: stable procedures, non-adversarial policies, psychological safety, transparent governance. Responsibility equals emergent autonomy: it arises when expectations are clear, choices are real, support is consistent, and consequences are fair. We cannot demand responsibility into existence. We can design for it.

## Towards a European Research Agenda

Europe's unique position between Humboldtian autonomy and Bologna standardisation makes it an ideal laboratory for a new research programme. Questions worth investigating include: How can 'structural respect' be measured empirically? How do different policies on artificial intelligence affect trust and responsibility? How does teacher autonomy shape student autonomy? Can tutor systems be analysed as trust infrastructures? Can inequity in assessment be modelled as signal degradation? What is the 'entropy budget' of a course? How can institutions detect trust degradation early—before collapse into adversarial dynamics, surveillance measures, or burnout? These are scientific questions requiring interdisciplinary collaboration across physics, psychology, sociology, educational science, human–computer interaction, and ethics.

## Seven Anchors for One Claim

If condensed to a single sentence: _where institutions cultivate respect and trust coherently, responsibility arises naturally—among students, among teachers, and within the institution itself._ Seven research strands support this claim: the German _Didaktik_ tradition; Self-Determination Theory; research on teacher autonomy; Gable's hidden curriculum studies; the Transparency in Learning and Teaching experiments; Noddings' ethics of care; and research on artificial intelligence demonstrating the limits of surveillance. Together they form a coherent philosophical and empirical foundation.

## The Responsibility We Actually Owe

Shifting from heroism to system design is not a retreat from responsibility; it is its fulfilment. Students deserve structures that encode respect rather than leave it to chance. Teachers deserve conditions that make trust plausible. Universities deserve systems that minimise entropy and maximise care.

We are unlikely to rebuild higher education from first principles. But we can maintain the machinery we have. A clockwork does not fail because of grand mechanical flaws; it fails because dust accumulates in the gears. Our task—each of us, within our own scope—is to identify and remove those particles of friction: the unclear deadline, the unanswered question, the opaque policy, the unnecessary form. Small interventions, consistently applied, restore smooth operation. System change is not revolution. It is maintenance.

A system that gets respect, trust, and responsibility right does not depend on heroic individuals. It produces communities.
