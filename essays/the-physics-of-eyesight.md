# The Physics of Eyesight

Sunlit rays scatter from a keyboard, slip through a pupil about&#x20;3 mm wide, and—after a single bend in cornea and lens—project a&#x20;20 mm miniature 2D image onto the retina. Bright-day optics&#x20;sharpen this image to about 1 arc-minute resolution, neatly&#x20;matching the 2 μm spacing of foveal cones. At twilight, iris&#x20;dilation admits five times more light but inevitably softens&#x20;each edge—a non-negotiable trade-off.

Visual scenes arrive as a swift stream of roughly ten trillion&#x20;photons per second. Each photon absorbed in a rod cell can&#x20;trigger a molecular flip, with rods integrating signals at&#x20;around 50 Hz to tame Poissonian noise. Faster cones sort&#x20;incoming photons at 100 Hz into so-called "red", "green", and"blue" wavelength channels. Optimised retinal circuits rapidly&#x20;subtract backgrounds and accentuate edges, compressing the&#x20;gigabit-scale data stream down to a manageable trickle of tens&#x20;of megabits per second along the optic nerve. The brain then&#x20;imposes its internal model at approximately 20 Hz, using&#x20;predictive loops to weigh incoming neural spikes against&#x20;expectations: familiar patterns are suppressed, unexpected&#x20;events amplified. Quick eye movements reaching angular speeds of&#x20;up to 600°/s occur several times per second, constantly steering&#x20;the fovea centralis toward whatever appears informative. More&#x20;than 90% of the raw data is discarded or re-ranked before it&#x20;ever reaches conscious perception. Thus, what enters awareness&#x20;is not a mere reflection of reality, but a strongly filtered&#x20;hypothesis, shaped by prior knowledge and current goals. Each&#x20;individual generates distinct space-time viewpoints, biased by&#x20;their experiences.

Our vision thus exists in duality: on one hand, it generates an&#x20;internal, imaginary reconstruction of the external world; on the&#x20;other, it serves as an actively tuned control system that counts&#x20;quanta, edits sensory information, and continuously tests and&#x20;recalibrates intuitions more than a hundred times per second.&#x20;Human eyesight, as a highly adaptable and integrated sensor,&#x20;grounds us in active feedback within our complex environment.
