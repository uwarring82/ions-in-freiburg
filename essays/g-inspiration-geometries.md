### Abstract

This essay proposes two complementary parameters for navigating how cultural artefacts order human attention: lambda, which orders artefacts by engagement geometry, and psi, which measures the impedance encountered when crossing between regimes. The domain of validity is cultural artefacts competing for finite human attention; the aim is orientation, not prescription.

### Opening

Some artefacts recruit crowds; others recruit lifetimes. A stadium anthem aligns tens of thousands in minutes. A polyglot novel captures a few hundred readers for decades. Both induce what we loosely call inspiration, yet the cognitive architectures they demand differ so profoundly that grouping them under a single term obscures more than it reveals.

Lambda orders cultural artefacts by the typical cognitive time required to reach a first coherent moment of inspiration relative to the number of participants attempting it. Low lambda marks broad networked synchrony—rapid uptake across large audiences. High lambda marks deep serial decoding—slow uptake sustained by individual persistence. Psi, attentional impedance, describes the resistance encountered when moving between lambda regimes. Reducing psi—through guides, annotations, or community scaffolding—boosts access but increases vulnerability to metric capture, because the scaffolding itself becomes an optimisation target. Both parameters are heuristics, not metrics; they locate artefacts and transitions on a continuum without claiming to measure inspiration itself.

The same architectural lens that reveals constraints in physical measurement systems—where comparison geometry governs what can be observed—suggests a compass for cultural attention. This is not a new invention but an exported heuristic: constraints on comparison appear wherever finite resources meet distributed signals.

### The bullshit foil

Before applying the compass, it helps to define what inspiration is _not_.

Harry Frankfurt characterised bullshit as communication indifferent to truth-value. The bullshitter neither asserts nor denies what is true. He simply disregards the question. Inspiration works differently. It is stake-sensitive and truth-rewarding. It exacts a toll and returns a yield.

The reward structure takes two forms. _Verifiable_ inspiration pays off against evidence: claims can be checked. _Decidable_ inspiration pays off against continued engagement: interpretive frameworks grow richer with time. Bullshit can mimic this. Attention-economy content often deploys high cognitive hooks—outrage, novelty, scandal—that mask indifference to truth-value. But bullshit cannot sustain the reward structure. Over time, the yield collapses.

This distinction echoes debates familiar from critical theory—Adorno's culture-industry critique, Bourdieu's anatomy of distinction—here reframed as neutral engagement geometries rather than hierarchies of taste.

### Personal narrative: how the compass emerged

The lambda compass did not arrive as abstraction. It crystallised across two summers, one autumn, and a winter conversation.

In summer 2024, on an island in the Mediterranean, I read Rutger Bregman's _Humankind_. A colleague had left it on my desk months earlier with little explanation—just the book as a birthday present, spine uncracked. Bregman, a Dutch historian, published _Humankind_ in 2020 as a corrective to cynical assumptions about human nature. The book argues that cooperation is the deeper evolutionary baseline, using accessible narrative and vivid case studies pitched for rapid uptake. Reading it in the shade of palm trees, I noticed how quickly its ideas entered conversation—with my partner over dinner, with my children and friends near the pool or on the beach. The lambda was low: minimal cognitive barrier, broad social resonance, coherence achieved in hours.

In summer 2025, on the same island, I read Yuval Noah Harari's _Nexus_—the same colleague had recommended it. Harari, an Israeli historian, published _Nexus_ in 2024 as a meditation on information networks and civilisational order. The book is denser, more speculative. Its central metaphor—that societies are information-processing systems whose outputs depend on network topology—requires slower digestion. I found myself returning to passages between swims, testing claims against other reading, debating implications internally before voicing them. The lambda was higher: fewer participants would complete the book, but those who did would carry its frameworks longer.

In late autumn 2025, the same colleague suggested a third book: James Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_. The recommendation came with a warning: this one would take decades, not days. I ordered a copy, opened it, tried reading a few lines, but closed it almost immediately. The impedance felt prohibitive.

Then, at the beginning of the winter holidays, a conversation with my neighbour shifted the frame entirely. She is in her mid-twenties, studies English and Education, and has evolved into one of my most valued discussion partners—someone who reacts quickly with keen counter-arguments that keep me honest. We were exchanging our latest hot topics when she mentioned Taylor Swift, not as guilty pleasure but as genuine interpretive challenge. She had spent considerable time decoding album arcs, tracking Easter eggs across music videos, constructing narrative theories that rivalled literary exegesis in complexity. The provocation struck me mid-conversation: Taylor Swift may have recruited my neighbour's sustained attention more effectively than any of her university professors.

We agreed on a mutual homework for the Christmas break: she would write an essay decoding Swift's symbolic architecture; I would write this one. The symmetry felt apt—two engagement geometries, two essays, one shared deadline.

That provocation forced the question into focus. Swift and Joyce occupy opposite limits of an ordering parameter I had not yet named. Bregman and Harari occupy intermediate positions. The compass emerged not from theory but from the friction between these encounters—Mediterranean summers, an autumn suggestion, a winter conversation. I am drafting this essay in January 2026, during the same winter holiday, trying to articulate what the friction revealed.

I frame these books explicitly as catalysts, not evidence. What they offered was a lived contrast in engagement regimes—a forced articulation of lambda from incompatible attentional demands.

### Breadth-first inspiration

Taylor Swift exemplifies the low-lambda regime at civilisational scale. Her music mobilises vast audiences through emotionally legible cues, participatory motifs, and puzzle-like hints embedded across albums and performances. Cognitive cost for first coherence is low; stability emerges from networked reinforcement—algorithmic recommendations, online discourse, fan communities that amplify and synchronise reception. Swift is an architect of engagement, designing artefacts optimised for breadth without sacrificing emotional stakes.

A counter-argument deserves acknowledgment: mass-culture artefacts can carry long-term epistemic stakes. Swift's thematic arcs—narrative continuity across albums, evolving public persona—sustain interpretive labour for devoted fans over years. My neighbour has spent more cumulative hours on Swift exegesis than I have spent on Harari. Low lambda does not preclude depth; it distributes depth unevenly across participants.

Yet the regime carries Goodhart-like risk. When proxies such as chart positions, streaming counts, or engagement metrics become optimisation targets, the system drifts: measurable popularity decouples from inspiration quality. This is a scaffolding failure—social scaffolding, in this case—where the support structure becomes the target rather than the enabler.

***

### Depth-first inspiration

James Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ occupies the opposite limit. The text is linguistically dense, recursive, resistant to paraphrase. It withholds coherence until the reader has invested years, not hours. Stability emerges from sustained epistemic curiosity—a recursive loop between text and interpreter requiring no external validation.

Joyce navigated popular media strategically: serialisation, censorship controversy, deliberate obscurity as publicity. Yet the Wake's reception history converged on prolonged, solitary engagement. The artefact enforces minimum cognitive stake; no social amplification substitutes for decoding labour.

A counter-argument here too: dense artefacts occasionally achieve bursts of collective synchrony when mediated—a viral exegesis, a documentary, a cultural moment that temporarily lowers psi. These bursts are rare but real; high lambda does not preclude synchrony, only makes it episodic rather than continuous.

The regime carries symmetric Goodhart risk. Scholarly prestige, canonical editions, and annotation circles can become targets for credentialling rather than inspiration. This is also a scaffolding failure—interpretive scaffolding, where the apparatus for access becomes the object of optimisation. Both regimes fail identically in structure: scaffolding capture displaces the engagement it was built to enable.

***

### Transitions and impedance

The psi parameter governs movement between regimes. When psi is lowered—through accessible guides, community exegesis, or pedagogical scaffolding—uptake increases but Goodhart exposure rises. Making Joyce "easy" via annotations no longer measures the same inspiration event; the scaffold has become the artefact. Conversely, when psi remains high, access collapses but metric capture is avoided. The trade-off is not resolvable; it is navigable.

Contemporary digital culture produces frontier artefacts testing this boundary. Transmedia franchises, alternate-reality games, and global fandoms exhibit features of both regimes. Swiftie annotation subcultures—Easter-egg tracking, cross-album exegesis—function as high-lambda enclaves within a predominantly low-lambda ecosystem. My neighbour inhabits precisely this frontier: rapid emotional synchrony with millions of fans, yet years of serial decoding labour that rivals any Wake circle. These hybrid systems preview how future cultural artefacts might integrate rapid uptake with sustained decoding.

***

### The AI inflection

Generative AI drives production cost toward zero, making attention the sole bottleneck. Both regimes face stress. Low-lambda systems risk being outcompeted by cost-indifferent content mimicking emotional cues without grounding them in verifiable stakes—bullshit by Frankfurt's definition. High-lambda systems risk irrelevance if interpretive infrastructure erodes or if audiences habituated to instant coherence lose tolerance for deferred meaning.

A third risk emerges: latent lambda. If AI can simulate high-lambda artefacts—producing text that appears to require decades of decoding—then lambda becomes unobservable. The Wake's lambda is credible because its impedance is verifiable; the text actually is that dense. AI-generated artefacts may have uncertain lambda, creating a new attentional risk: mispricing cognitive investment. The question is no longer only which regime prevails, but whether lambda itself remains a legible signal.

Research directions suggest themselves: adaptive information topologies that modulate decoding difficulty in response to participant persistence; human-in-the-loop complexity calibration; credibility architectures that certify lambda without collapsing it.

***

### A lambda-aware choice

The copy of _Finnegans Wake_ arrived in December. I have opened it now—a few pages, enough to sense the texture. The physical weight of the book, the flipping between text and annotation, the haptic resistance of high-lambda engagement. The full decoding task is deferred, perhaps to retirement. This deferral is not failure of will but rational allocation under scarcity: my current psi budget does not accommodate the Wake's impedance. The compass does not dictate the path; it clarifies the cost.

Cultural information networks self-order, but we should not expect convergence to a single, true order. Ordering is a resilience strategy under noise, not a theorem about truth. Lambda locates artefacts on a continuum of engagement geometry; it does not rank them by proximity to truth. The compass orients without directing.

***

### Limitations

Lambda and psi are heuristic ordering parameters; cognitive uptake time and participation breadth resist precise measurement. This unmeasurability is partly a feature: it prevents the compass from becoming a target, Goodhart-proofing the framework itself. The analysis assumes stable interpretive infrastructure, which may degrade under institutional stress. Goodhart vulnerabilities are asserted symmetrically but not quantified.

***

### Closing beat

Inspiration is not the artefact but the geometry it winds into attention under scarcity. Some geometries recruit millions in parallel; others recruit individuals in series across decades. Neither regime is superior; both are vulnerable to scaffolding capture; each addresses a different failure mode of cultural transmission.

Lambda and psi do not resolve the tension between breadth and depth—they make the tension navigable. As artefacts become cheap and attention remains costly, the question is not which regime prevails, but which engagement topologies remain legible and resilient when symbols are abundant, lambda is fakeable, and time is finite.

That question remains open. It may be the only question worth recruiting a lifetime to answer.
