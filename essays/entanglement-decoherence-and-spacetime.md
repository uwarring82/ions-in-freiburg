# Entanglement, Decoherence, and Spacetime

In a lab, we can count individual photons—emitted one at a time from a single&#x20;trapped ion—hitting a screen and integrating to bright spots. According to the&#x20;path‐integral picture, each photon “tests” every possible route from ion to&#x20;detector, and interference makes those paths that minimize the action stand out&#x20;as more likely. Unobserved, these photons form smooth interference fringes; the&#x20;moment we look, each one lands at a single point in what’s sometimes called the&#x20;collapse of the wave function. This simple setup exposes the measurement&#x20;problem: quantum mechanics tells us how amplitudes evolve and interfere, but&#x20;never explains why—or how—a unique outcome appears on our screen.

From the beginning, physicists have wrestled with this gap. In the Copenhagen&#x20;interpretation, Bohr and Heisenberg drew a “cut” between the quantum system and&#x20;classical apparatus, treating this collapse as a fundamental postulate. Von&#x20;Neumann later formalized this with his projection postulate, pushing the mystery&#x20;to the observer’s mind. Everett’s many-worlds view threw out collapse entirely,&#x20;positing that every outcome happens in a branching of the so-called multiverse.&#x20;Objective collapse models instead tweak Schrödinger’s equation to trigger real,&#x20;physical reductions, at the price of adding new constants. These debates dateback nearly a century and were fiercely argued by the founders of quantum&#x20;theory, yet no single view has won universal acceptance. Moreover, the stunning&#x20;success of quantum mechanics—in predicting experiments and powering technologies&#x20;from transistors to lasers—led many practitioners to adopt a “shut up and&#x20;calculate” mindset, reluctant to revisit what can feel like metaphysical puzzles&#x20;when the formalism works so well to win prizes.

A more physical account comes from decoherence, where entanglement with&#x20;countless environmental degrees of freedom—air molecules, stray photons, thermal&#x20;vibrations—washes out phase information and makes superpositions appear to“disappear.” Decoherence doesn’t force a literal collapse, but it does explain&#x20;why classical outcomes emerge without changing quantum laws. Some recent, highly&#x20;speculative ideas even suggest that the same entanglement responsible for&#x20;decoherence may build space time itself. Van Raamsdonk showed that gluing&#x20;together many entangled qubits can recreate a smooth spacetime geometry. A&#x20;conjecture of Maldacena and Susskind envisions each entangled pair as joined by&#x20;a tiny wormhole, hinting that gravity could be the bookkeeping of quantum links.&#x20;While this is far from tested experimentally, it suggests a deep, if speculative, connection:&#x20;the very process that selects definite outcomes might also weave the fabric of&#x20;space and time, and, thus, bring us into existence. It all leaves me wondering&#x20;how complex it can be to describe a single photon hitting a detector without&#x20;running into logic conflicts.
