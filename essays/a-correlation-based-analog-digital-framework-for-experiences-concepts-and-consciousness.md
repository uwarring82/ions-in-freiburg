**Disclaimer** – This document presents an exploratory and interdisciplinary framework that links physical correlation structures with cognitive and phenomenological concepts. The ideas developed here are speculative, conceptual, and intended to stimulate discussion rather than assert established scientific fact. While many arguments draw inspiration from physics, neuroscience, and philosophy, the framework does not claim empirical validation and should not be interpreted as a definitive theory of mind, consciousness, or cognitive architecture. Any analogies to human experience or phenomenology are heuristic and do not imply medical, psychological, or metaphysical assertions. The content is offered solely for academic reflection, collaborative development, and conceptual exploration.

In this framework, correlations between analog and digital components constitute memories in the most general physical sense, with experiences referring specifically to short-range memory correlations. Mid-range, scale-free memory correlations give rise to concepts, understood as intermediate, self-similar structures shaped by critical dynamics. When these multiscale memory structures transiently align into a global, metastable correlation pattern—a system-wide memory state—we call this consciousness. Our aim is to articulate these notions from a fundamentally physical perspective on complex network structures, while drawing on deep analogies from human experience to anchor the abstractions. In doing so, we build in two complementary angles of attack: a bottom-up route grounded in physical and computational mechanisms, and a top-down route grounded in phenomenological and conceptual structure—allowing the framework to be tested, constrained, and benchmarked from both directions.
