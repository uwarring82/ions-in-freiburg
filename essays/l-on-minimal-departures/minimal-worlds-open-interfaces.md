#### I. Prelude — Minimal Departures

A recurring lesson in physics is that structure does not require abundance.

A symmetry breaks with a single perturbation. Dynamics emerge from minimal coupling. A world becomes interesting not when complexity accumulates, but when the smallest permitted departure is allowed to act.

The essay _On Minimal Departures_ treats this as a general design principle: worlds—physical or conceptual—arise from carefully constrained asymmetry. This Sail explores a resonance between that principle and the Compatible Ordinans Perspective, where worlds are defined not by internal richness, but by which couplings are made explicit and which are deliberately excluded.

This is an exploration, not an extension.

***

#### II. Ordinans as Method, Not Ontology

The Compatible Ordinans Perspective is a methodological framework. Its central discipline is subtraction:

> _What disappears when a coupling is removed?_

Noise, measurement, feedback, clocks, and environments are treated as interfaces—explicit, switchable, testable. Their role is architectural, not metaphysical. The framework does not answer _what is real_. It structures which claims are architecturally load-bearing within a given experimental or modelling context.

What counts as "a world" philosophically remains an open key. The framework supplies the lock—the constraints on coherent discourse—not the key that unlocks any particular ontological commitment.

***

#### III. A Cautious Resonance with the Simulation Argument

[The Simulation Argument](https://simulation-argument.com/simulation/) operates in a different epistemic domain. It concerns probability across possible worlds, driven by assumptions about computational capacity and observer counts. The ordinans perspective neither confirms nor refutes that argument; it does not adjust the probability that we inhabit a simulation.

What it offers instead is a complementary methodological question:

> _Under what conditions would a simulation claim become operationally meaningful?_

This is not a probabilistic question but a structural one. Any resemblance between the two frameworks is therefore a resonance of _methodological temperament_, not formal convergence. They address orthogonal concerns.

***

#### IV. Interfaces and Scientific Hygiene

Within its own scope, the ordinans framework enforces a simple discipline:

> _Only claims tied to explicit, switchable interfaces are architecturally actionable._

This is not an ontological filter. It is a form of scientific hygiene. If a proposed explanatory element produces identical predictions whether present or absent, invoking it adds narrative weight but no architectural support.

The value of the framework lies precisely in this restraint: it prevents explanatory drift without declaring what ultimately exists.

***

#### V. Speculative Aside — Worlds as Interfaced Modules

_(Conceptual thought-experiment, non-architectural)_

The following is speculative and intentionally outside the framework's testable scope.

One may imagine—purely as a thought-experiment—a cosmos structured not as a hierarchy of nested simulations, but as a network of interfaced modules. In this image, a world is defined less by internal computational depth than by the clarity of its boundaries: what it couples to, what it excludes, what can be switched off without collapse.

This image does not assert that reality is so structured. It mirrors a methodological instinct from physics: clarity arises from boundaries, not accumulation. Its purpose is to generate questions, not falsifiable structure.

***

#### VI. Resonance, Not Convergence

The Simulation Argument and the Compatible Ordinans Perspective do not converge in substance.

* **Simulation Argument:** Concerned with observer statistics across hypothetical worlds.
* **Ordinans Perspective:** Concerned with falsifiability and control _within_ a world.

Their shared emphasis on boundaries should be understood as a resonance of sensibility—a shared instinct that structure emerges from constraint—not a shared claim about the nature of reality.

***

#### VII. Sailing, Not Mapping

Frameworks endure by refusing to overreach. They enable exploration without dictating destination.

This Sail moves between minimal departures, ordinans, and speculative simulations not to unify them, but to show how careful boundary-drawing—conceptual, experimental, or narrative—allows worlds to remain intelligible.

Maps remain stable.\
Sails may change.
