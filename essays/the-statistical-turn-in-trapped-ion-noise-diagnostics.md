### Abstract

Motional decoherence in trapped-ion systems is conventionally characterised by a single scalar—the heating rate $$\dot{\bar{n}}$$. This reporting convention discards statistical information that distinguishes fundamentally different noise mechanisms requiring different mitigation strategies. We present a Tier-2 operational framework—the Decision Engine—that classifies electromagnetically coupled noise into three operational classes (Gaussian diffusion, compound-Poisson jumps, Lévy-type heavy-tailed processes) within the validity domain of harmonic confinement, Markovian bath dynamics, and stationary statistics. Classification proceeds via two dimensionless scalars: the event-count parameter $$\lambda\tau$$ and the Markov-accessibility parameter $$\mu = \tau/\tau_c$$. We provide a numbered decision protocol with explicit gate nodes, shot-count estimates, and a three-pillar validation architecture incorporating mandatory consistency closure. All claims are bounded to single-ion motional decoherence under linear electromagnetic coupling; extensions beyond this domain are flagged as out-of-scope branch conditions.

### 1. Introduction — The Statistical Turn

#### 1.1 Anomalous heating as bottleneck

The scalability of trapped-ion quantum information processing remains constrained by motional decoherence—the uncontrolled degradation of the harmonic oscillator's quantum state through interaction with electromagnetic environments. For over three decades, the community has characterised this process through a single figure of merit: the mean heating rate $$\dot{\bar{n}}$$, typically extracted from sideband thermometry after variable delay times. Comprehensive reviews have catalogued the dependence of $$\dot{\bar{n}}$$ on frequency, ion–surface distance, and temperature, seeking correlations with surface-science models of patch potentials, adatom fluctuators, and electrode contamination (Brownnutt et al., 2015).

#### 1.2 Why heating-rate-only reporting is epistemically lossy

The reduction of complex environmental dynamics to a single scalar discards the vast majority of statistical information carried by the noise signal. Two physically distinct noise processes—one consisting of many weak, continuous fluctuations, the other of rare but violent momentum kicks—can produce identical values of $$\dot{\bar{n}}$$ whilst requiring orthogonal mitigation strategies. The heating rate is a second-moment quantity; it is blind to skewness, kurtosis, waiting-time structure, and tail behaviour. Under the implicit assumption of Gaussian statistics, the power spectral density $$S_E(\omega)$$ is a sufficient statistic. When that assumption fails—as it must for discrete collision events, charging transients, or heavy-tailed excursions—the spectral approach systematically misdiagnoses the environment.

#### 1.3 Statistical Universality Hypothesis (bounded)

Within the validity domain of single-ion harmonic confinement, linear electromagnetic coupling, Markovian bath dynamics, and stationary noise statistics (§9), we advance the following bounded hypothesis: all electromagnetically coupled noise sources acting on a trapped ion's motional degree of freedom fall into one of three operational classes, distinguished by the statistical character of the environmental current sources $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ that drive the fields. These classes—Gaussian (diffusive), compound-Poisson (jump-dominated), and Lévy-type (heavy-tailed)—arise from the Lévy–Khintchine decomposition of infinitely divisible processes and are exhaustive within the stated domain. The classification is operational: it determines which observables are informative and which measurement strategies are optimal, independently of the microscopic identity of the source.

This hypothesis does _not_ claim universality across all quantum systems, all coupling mechanisms, or all decoherence channels. It is restricted to motional decoherence of a single trapped ion under electromagnetic coupling within the Markov-accessible zone defined below.

#### 1.4 Deliverable: Decision Engine and validation separation

The primary deliverable of this Sail is the **Decision Engine** (§7)—a procedural protocol that converts abstract statistical classification into a linear sequence of experimental decisions. The secondary deliverable is the **Validation Architecture** (§8), which enforces rigorous separation between inference validity (did we identify the correct statistical class?) and physical predictability (does the identified class match the microscopic model?), joined by a mandatory consistency closure test.

### 3. Universal Mediation Principle (T1 Import)

The interaction between a trapped ion at equilibrium position $\mathbf{r}\_0$ and its electromagnetic environment is governed by

\$$H\_\text{int} = -qx , E\_x(\mathbf{r}\_0, t),\$$

where $E\_x$ is the $x$-component of the electric field. The field is not an independent degree of freedom; it is generated by stochastic current densities $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ distributed throughout the environment—electrodes, dielectrics, vacuum chamber walls, background gas—and mediated by the electromagnetic Green tensor:

\$$E\_x(\mathbf{r}_0, \omega) = i\mu\_0 \omega \int \mathrm{d}^3 r ; G_{x\alpha}(\mathbf{r}_0, \mathbf{r}; \omega) , J_\alpha(\mathbf{r}, \omega).\$$

The force spectrum entering the master equation is

\$$S\_F(\omega) = q^2 \int \mathrm{d}^3 r , \mathrm{d}^3 r' ; G\_{x\alpha}(\mathbf{r}_0, \mathbf{r}; \omega) , S_{JJ}^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'; \omega) , G\_{x\beta}^\*(\mathbf{r}\_0, \mathbf{r}'; \omega).\$$

This factorisation is the Universal Mediation Principle (within the linear-coupling domain): the problem separates into a **deterministic filter** ($\mathbf{G}$, encoding trap geometry and material response) and a **stochastic driver** ($\mathbf{J}$, encoding the temporal dynamics of the source). The geometry does not change the statistical class of the noise—only its magnitude and spectral colour. A Gaussian source produces Gaussian fields at the ion; a Poissonian source produces Poissonian fields. Linear response preserves the character of the distribution.

| Spectral shape of $S\_F(\omega)$              | Both $\mathbf{G}$ and $S\_{JJ}$                       | Yes — $\mathbf{G}$ filters spectral content      |

| Heating/dephasing balance                     | Spectral weight near $\omega\_t$ vs. near $0$         | Yes — $\mathbf{G}$ redistributes spectral weight |
| Directional anisotropy                        | Spatial structure of $\mathbf{G}$                     | Yes — extended trajectories break isotropy       |

**Implication for diagnostics.** The trap can be treated as a known filter. Diagnostic effort focuses on analysing the _output_ statistics of the ion's motional state to infer the _input_ statistics of the environment.

### 4. Regime Classifier

Classification proceeds via two dimensionless scalars that gate all subsequent analysis.

#### 4.1 The event-count parameter $\lambda\tau$

\$$\lambda\tau = \text{(characteristic event rate)} \times \text{(interrogation time per shot)}.\$$

For impulsive processes, $\lambda$ is the Poisson arrival rate. For continuous fields, $\lambda^{-1}$ represents an effective correlation time, so $\lambda\tau \sim \tau/\tau\_c$ counts independent fluctuation intervals. The parameter organises _temporal statistics_:

* $\lambda\tau \gg 1$ **(diffusive regime):** Many events per shot. Central Limit Theorem applies. Statistics appear Gaussian regardless of single-event character.
* $\lambda\tau \sim 1$ **(intermediate regime):** Zero to a few events per shot. Non-Gaussian cumulants become measurable. This is typically the most diagnostic regime.
* $\lambda\tau \ll 1$ **(sparse regime):** Most shots show no event. Rare shots show large jumps. Waiting-time distributions become the primary observable.

**Crucially, $\lambda\tau$ characterises event statistics, not spectral content.** A Gaussian source with $1/f$ spectrum ($\lambda\tau \gg 1$) can produce strong dephasing but weak heating; a Poisson collision process ($\lambda\tau \ll 1$) with large momentum transfer produces primarily heating. The framework treats both aspects independently.

#### 4.2 The Markov-accessibility parameter $\mu$

\$$\mu = \frac{\tau}{\tau\_c},\$$

where $\tau\_c$ is the bath correlation time—the timescale over which environmental correlations decay. The parameter gates the _validity of the Markov approximation_:

* $\mu \gg 1$ **(Markov-accessible zone):** The interrogation time spans many bath correlation times. The memoryless approximation holds. The Lévy–Khintchine generator is valid. **The Decision Engine operates normally.**
* $\mu \lesssim 1$ **(Markov-inaccessible zone):** Environmental memory persists across the measurement window. The generator formalism breaks down. **The Decision Engine degrades to a screening heuristic.** Non-Markov branches (memory-kernel methods, fractional Brownian motion) must be pursued separately.

#### 4.3 Joint gating logic

Both scalars must be evaluated before classification proceeds. The $\mu$ gate is applied _first_: if $\mu \lesssim 1$, the Engine halts normal classification and flags the output as provisional. Only when $\mu \gg 1$ does $\lambda\tau$ determine which observables to prioritise.

**Failure mode.** If only $\lambda\tau$ is evaluated without $\mu$, a source with slow environmental memory ($\tau\_c \sim \tau$) could be misclassified as sparse-Poisson ($\lambda\tau \ll 1$) when it is in fact non-Markovian. The $\mu$ gate prevents this diagnostic error.

### 5. Three Operational Classes (Bounded)

Within the Markov-accessible zone ($\mu \gg 1$), under harmonic confinement and stationary statistics, all electromagnetically coupled noise falls into three operational classes distinguished by the Lévy–Khintchine decomposition of the master-equation generator:

\$$\dot{\rho} = -i\[H\_0, \rho] + \mathcal{D}\_G\[\rho] + \mathcal{J}\_P\[\rho],\$$

where $\mathcal{D}\_G$ is the Gaussian diffusion superoperator and $\mathcal{J}\_P$ is the compound-Poisson jump superoperator. Heavy-tailed Lévy processes extend $\mathcal{J}\_P$ to divergent-variance jump-size distributions.

#### 5.1 Gaussian (Diffusive) — $\lambda\tau \gg 1$

**Physical picture.** Many weak, independent fluctuations aggregate via the Central Limit Theorem. Sources include Johnson–Nyquist noise in electrodes, control-field pickup, dense patch-potential fluctuations, and high-flux photon scattering.

**Domain note.** The PSD is a sufficient statistic _only_ within this class. Applying spectral methods to non-Gaussian noise produces systematically biased estimates.

#### 5.2 Compound-Poisson (Jump-Dominated) — $\lambda\tau \sim 1$ to $\ll 1$

**Physical picture.** Discrete, independent events deliver momentum kicks $\Delta p$ drawn from a distribution $\nu(\Delta p)$ with finite variance. Each kick implements the unitary displacement $U\_{\Delta p} = \exp\[-i\Delta p , x/\hbar]$, simultaneously changing the ion's energy and phase. Sources include background-gas collisions (Langevin, hard-sphere, resonant charge exchange), single-photon recoil at low flux, and bistable fluctuators (telegraph noise).

**Domain note.** The compound-Poisson class requires finite variance of $\nu(\Delta p)$. When variance diverges, the process enters the Lévy-type class.

#### 5.3 Lévy-Type (Heavy-Tailed) — Power-Law $\nu(\Delta p)$

**Physical picture.** Jump-size distributions with power-law tails $\nu(\Delta p) \propto |\Delta p|^{-1-\alpha}$ for $0 < \alpha < 2$ produce divergent variance and anomalous diffusion $\langle(\Delta x)^2\rangle \propto t^{2/\alpha}$. Candidate mechanisms include Coulomb scattering on charged dust grains (long-range $1/r^2$ potential), micro-discharge events, cosmic-ray impacts, and possibly self-organised-critical surface-patch avalanches.

Beyond the stability horizon ($T\_\text{acq}$ exceeds practical drift-free measurement windows), downgrade to **detection-only**: report "heavy tails detected" without quantitative $\alpha$. |
| **Mitigation lever** _(handbook-level strategy)_ | Averaging is counterproductive (rare catastrophic events contaminate the mean). Use robust statistics (median, trimmed mean); threshold-based rejection of extreme excursions; erasure-conversion protocols in quantum error correction; reduce defect density (a single Lévy-type defect can dominate even in otherwise clean systems).                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Critical distinction:** Lévy-type heavy tails do _not_ automatically imply long memory. A Lévy process can be i.i.d. (memoryless jumps with heavy-tailed sizes) or clustered (correlated inter-event times). The i.i.d. vs. clustered distinction must be tested explicitly via autocorrelation of exceedances. Clustering would indicate a non-Markov component and trigger the $\mu$-gate degradation.

### 7. Validation Architecture

#### Pillar 1 — Classification Power (Inference Validity)

**Question:** Given finite data, can we reliably distinguish the three classes?

**Method:** Monte Carlo confusion matrix. Generate synthetic datasets for each class (Gaussian, compound-Poisson, Lévy-type) with parameters matching the experimental regime (including realistic readout fidelity, drift contamination, and finite $N$). Feed synthetic data through the Decision Engine. Compute $C\_{ij} = P(\text{predicted class } i \mid \text{true class } j)$.

**Requirement:** Diagonal elements $C\_{ii} > 0.90$ at the achieved shot count $N$. If off-diagonal confusion is high (e.g., Lévy frequently misclassified as Poisson), the data volume is insufficient. Action: acquire more shots or accept reduced classification confidence with explicit error bars.

**Minimum shot counts** for $>90%$ diagonal (indicative):

* Gaussian vs. Poisson: $N \sim 10^3\text{–}10^4$
* Poisson vs. Lévy tail: $N \sim 10^5\text{–}10^6$ (tail events)

**Recommended tests:** Anderson–Darling (sensitive to tail deviations) over Kolmogorov–Smirnov.

#### Pillar 2 — Physical Predictability (Model Correctness)

**Question:** Does the identified statistical class align with the physics predicted by the Green tensor and known source models?

**Method:** Compare inferred parameters against independent physical predictions:

* If Class I (Gaussian) identified: heating rate should exhibit predicted geometric scaling ($d^{-4}$ for patch potentials, $d^{-2}$ for Johnson noise). Temperature dependence should match ($\dot{\bar{n\}} \propto T$ for Johnson).
* If Class II (Poisson) identified: event rate $\lambda$ should scale linearly with background pressure (for gas collisions) or laser intensity (for photon scattering). Pressure-independence falsifies the gas-collision assignment.
* If Class III (Lévy-type) identified: candidate mechanism must physically support power-law momentum transfer (Coulomb scattering, not Langevin).

**Cross-validation protocol:** Deliberately perturb one physical parameter (e.g., worsen vacuum pressure by $10\times$) and verify that the Engine's inferred $\lambda$ responds as predicted. If it does not, the physical assignment is wrong even if the statistical classification is correct.

**Green tensor benchmarking:** Compare numerically computed $\mathbf{G}$ against measured heating-rate geometric scalings. Discrepancies indicate geometry-modelling errors that propagate into all quantitative predictions.

#### Pillar 3 — Consistency Closure (Mandatory)

**Question:** Do Pillars 1 and 2, taken together, produce a self-consistent picture?

**Closure equation.** Define the total predicted noise budget:

\$$\sigma\_\text{tot}^2 = \sigma\_\text{Gaussian}^2 + \sigma\_\text{Poisson}^2 + \sigma\_\text{Lévy}^2,\$$

where each term is computed from the inferred parameters of the respective class (diffusion coefficient, event rate $\times$ mean kick variance, tail contribution up to truncation). The closure test requires:

\$$\left| \frac{\sigma\_\text{tot}^2 - \sigma\_\text{measured}^2}{\sigma\_\text{measured}^2} \right| < \epsilon\_\text{closure},\$$

with $\epsilon\_\text{closure}$ set by the combined uncertainty budget (statistical + systematic).

**Failure actions:**

* If $\sigma\_\text{tot}^2 < \sigma\_\text{measured}^2$: a noise source is missing. Search for additional mechanisms.
* If $\sigma\_\text{tot}^2 > \sigma\_\text{measured}^2$: parameters are overestimated or classes are double-counted. Review inference assumptions.
* If closure fails after iterative refinement: archive as **Divergent** (per Council-3 Resolution Clause). Report the discrepancy explicitly; do not force agreement.

**Pillar-3 is mandatory.** Pillars 1 and 2 are necessary but not sufficient. Without closure, a statistically valid and physically plausible classification can still produce an inconsistent noise budget—indicating that the decomposition is incomplete or that the validity domain has been exceeded.

#### 7.4 Feasibility Gate for Lévy Exponent Inference

Estimating the stability parameter $\alpha$ from tail data requires sufficient events in the power-law regime. The acquisition timescale is

\$$T\_\text{acq} \sim \frac{N\_\text{ev\}}{\lambda , d},\$$

where $N\_\text{ev} \sim 10^3\text{–}10^4$ is the minimum number of tail events, $\lambda$ is the total event rate, and $d$ is the fraction of events exceeding the tail threshold.

**Stability horizon:** The maximum drift-free measurement window achievable with interleaved calibration (typically hours to a day, depending on laboratory stability).

* If $T\_\text{acq} <$ stability horizon: proceed with $\alpha$ estimation.
* If $T\_\text{acq} >$ stability horizon: **downgrade to detection-only.** Report that heavy tails are detected but $\alpha$ is not reliably estimable at current event rates. Do not publish a point estimate of $\alpha$ without the requisite statistical power.

### 8. Limitations and Extensions (Strictly Bounded)

The Decision Engine operates within the validity domain specified in §2 (Tier Map). The following extensions lie outside the current scope; branch conditions are defined to prevent silent extrapolation.

**Non-Markovian environments ($\mu \lesssim 1$).** When bath correlation times exceed the interrogation window—as for $1/f$ patch-potential fluctuations with very low corner frequencies—the Lévy–Khintchine generator is not applicable. Branch: memory-kernel methods, fractional Brownian motion frameworks, or whitening of known spectral drifts before re-entry into the Engine.

**Multi-ion correlated dynamics.** When multiple ions share a common potential, the Green tensor becomes a matrix coupling spatial modes. Common-mode noise (typically Class I technical noise) and differential-mode noise (potentially Class II/III surface effects) can in principle be separated, but the single-ion restriction of this Sail does not cover the inference protocol for correlated multi-mode decoherence. Branch: extend $\mathbf{G}$ to multi-mode form; modify cumulant analysis for joint distributions.

**Feedback and active stabilisation.** Closed-loop systems modify the effective noise statistics seen by the ion. The open-loop classification of this Sail applies to the _uncompensated_ noise; the effect of feedback on the residual noise class is a separate analysis.

**Non-electromagnetic decoherence.** Magnetic-field noise coupling to spin-motion entangled states, gravitational perturbations, and other non-electromagnetic channels are outside the universal-mediation framework. The Engine does not classify such sources.

**Heavy-tailed Lévy models (quantitative).** A full quantitative treatment of $\alpha < 2$ stable laws—including finite-size effects, truncated tails, and the crossover from compound-Poisson to genuinely heavy-tailed behaviour—requires dedicated theoretical and numerical work beyond the scope of this Sail. The current treatment provides a detection and feasibility framework; quantitative Lévy modelling is deferred to future coastline-level work.

_All extensions are flagged as out of scope; branch conditions are defined._

### 9. Conclusion — What Changes for Labs

#### Reporting standard

The Decision Engine implies a richer reporting standard than the conventional $\dot{\bar{n\}}$. We suggest that trapped-ion noise characterisation reports include, at minimum:

1. The heating rate $\dot{\bar{n\}}$ (for backward compatibility).
2. The regime parameters $\lambda\tau$ and $\mu$ at the measurement conditions used.
3. The identified operational class (Gaussian / compound-Poisson / Lévy-type / mixed / indeterminate) with confidence level.
4. Higher-order cumulants $\kappa\_3$, $\kappa\_4$ (even if consistent with zero—the null result is informative).
5. The full phonon distribution $P(n|\tau)$ or sufficient statistics thereof.
6. Validation status: which pillars passed, whether closure was achieved.

A trap with low $\dot{\bar{n\}}$ but Lévy-type statistics is, for quantum error correction purposes, potentially worse than a trap with higher $\dot{\bar{n\}}$ but confirmed Gaussian statistics—because uncorrectable extreme events defeat standard error correction codes whilst Gaussian noise can be managed by conventional filtering and averaging.

#### Protocol reference

This Sail is designed to serve as a protocol reference: the Decision Engine (§7) provides the operational flowchart; the validation architecture (§8) provides the quality assurance; the glossary (Appendix A) provides the shared vocabulary. Together, they define a reproducible methodology for statistical noise characterisation that can be adopted across laboratories without requiring each group to independently derive the underlying theory.

| Pillar                         | Question                                              | Method                                                                                                                                                          | Output                                    | Failure Action                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Classification power**    | Can we distinguish the three classes at achieved $N$? | Monte Carlo confusion matrix with synthetic data                                                                                                                | $C\_{ii} > 0.90$ required                 | Acquire more data or widen confidence interval                                                                                           |
| **2. Physical predictability** | Does the class match the physics?                     | Compare inferred $\lambda$, $\nu(\Delta p)$ against $\mathbf{G}$-tensor predictions and independent physical controls (pressure, temperature, geometry scaling) | Quantitative agreement within uncertainty | Revise physical-model assignment; seek alternative source                                                                                |
| **3. Consistency closure**     | Do Pillars 1+2 sum correctly?                         | Closure equation: $\lvert\sigma\_\text{tot}^2 - \sigma\_\text{measured}^2\rvert / \sigma\_\text{measured}^2 < \epsilon\_\text{closure}$                         | Pass/fail                                 | Missing source ($\sigma\_\text{tot}^2$ too small) or double-counting ($\sigma\_\text{tot}^2$ too large); iterate or archive as Divergent |

> **Feasibility gate** (Lévy tail inference): $T\_\text{acq} \sim N\_\text{ev}/(\lambda d)$. If $T\_\text{acq} >$ stability horizon → downgrade to detection-only; do not publish point estimate of $\alpha$.

> **Pillar 3 is mandatory.** Classification is provisional until closure is verified.
