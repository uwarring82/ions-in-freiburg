# Structure your research

_As a new member, you'll join a team dedicated to scientific discoveries. Here's how we aim to collaborate, the tools we use, and you may begin to identify your role in the team._

### Agile Project Management in Scientific Research

* **Agile Framework**: We aim to use Agile methodologies to organize work into sprints—short periods focused on specific tasks.
* **Sprint Planning**: At each sprint's start, we set goals and tasks, including time for literature reviews.
* **Daily Standups**: Brief daily meetings to update progress and address challenges.
* **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: We conclude sprints by reviewing work and discussing improvements.

### Team Roles

* **Product Owner**: Represents our commitment to the scientific community and integrity.
* **Scrum Master**: A senior scientist who facilitates Agile processes and supports the team.
* **Team Members**: Researchers, technicians, and analysts contributing their expertise.

### Tools We Use

* **GitLab**: Central repository for code, data, and documentation with version control.
* **Mattermost**: Platform for daily communication, problem solving, bookkeeping, and idea sharing.
* **Overleaf**: Collaborative platform for writing and editing scientific papers.

### Literature Review

Regular literature reviews are essential. We use tools like Mendeley or Zotero to manage and share publications.

_As a team member, you'll engage in all project aspects, from experiments to manuscript contributions. Your expertise is valuable in our collaborative effort to advance science. Welcome aboard!_

## Guidelines for Scientific Integrity

We adhere to strict guidelines to maintain honesty in science:

* **DFG White Paper**: ["Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice"](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/good_scientific_practice/index.html)
* **University Regulations**: [University of Freiburg's Academic Integrity](http://www.uni-freiburg.de/forschung-en/redlichkeit_in_der_wissenschaft?set_language=en)
* **Physics Recommendations**: From the Konferenz der Fachbereiche Physik

## Scientific Writing and Good Practices

Familiarize yourself with scientific writing standards:

* **IMRaD Structure**: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.
* **Journal Guidelines**: Refer to journals like [Physical Review](https://journals.aps.org/prl/authors) for manuscript preparation.
* **Writing Guides**:
  * M. van der Perk's [A Guide for Scientific Writing](https://students.uu.nl/sites/default/files/ge0-aw-guide-for-scientific-writing-2016.pdf)

## Keeping Track of Literature

* **Reference Managers**: Use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to organize literature and generate citations.
* **VPN Access**: Set up a [VPN connection](https://www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/services-en/netztel-en/vpn/vpn-einleitung-en?set_language=en) to access journals from home.
* **Literature Databases**: Use [ISI Web of Science](https://apps.webofknowledge.com/) for comprehensive searches.

## Integrated Workflow for Documentation

We integrate GitLab, Mattermost, and Overleaf for efficient collaboration.

1. **GitLab**: Central hub for code, data, and documentation with version control.
2. **Mattermost**: Real-time communication for updates and discussions.
3. **Overleaf**: Collaborative writing platform for scientific documents, synced with GitLab.

## Getting Started with the Tools

* **GitLab**: Learn via [GitLab Tutorials](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/).
* **Mattermost**: Explore the [Mattermost Documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/).
* **Overleaf**: Start with [Overleaf Tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials).

## Git Best Practices

* **Clear Commit Messages**: Describe changes meaningfully.
* **Use Branches**: Create branches for new features or fixes.
* **Frequent Commits**: Commit often to keep changes manageable.
* **Pull Requests**: Use for code reviews before merging.
* **Stay Synced**: Regularly pull updates from the main branch.

## Checklist to Initialize a New Project

1. **Create GitLab Repository**
   * Set up project structure.
2. **Set Up Mattermost Channel**
   * For team communication.
3. **Link Overleaf**
   * For collaborative writing.
4. **Configure Access**
   * Assign roles and permissions.
5. **Establish Communication Guidelines**
   * Outline protocols for tools.
6. **Document Workflow**
   * Describe project processes.
7. **Schedule Initial Meeting**
   * Discuss goals and tools.
