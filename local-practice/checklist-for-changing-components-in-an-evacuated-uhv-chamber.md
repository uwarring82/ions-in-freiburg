# Checklist for Changing Components in an evacuated UHV Chamber

#### **1. Preparation**

* **\[ ] Notify Personnel:**
  * Inform all relevant team members about the planned maintenance.
* **\[ ] Gather Necessary Equipment:**
  * Replacement component.
  * Clean, UHV-compatible tools.
  * New gaskets or O-rings if needed.
  * Cleanroom-grade gloves (powder-free nitrile or latex).
  * Cleanroom wipes and high-purity solvents (e.g., isopropanol).
* **\[ ] Prepare the Environment:**
  * Ensure the workspace is clean and free from dust.
  * Minimize airflow to prevent contamination.
  * Set up a clean surface to place removed components.
* **\[ ] Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**
  * Wear cleanroom gloves and a lab coat or cleanroom suit.

***

#### **2. System Verification**

* **\[ ] Confirm System Status:**
  * Verify the status of the UHV chamber: Ion getter pump and pressure gauge need to be operational.
  * Confirm that the pump stand (roughing pump and turbo pump) is available.
* **\[ ] Plan Venting Procedure:**
  * Determine the safest method to vent the chamber without introducing contaminants.
  * Ensure high-purity nitrogen gas is available for venting.

***

#### **3. Connecting the Pump Stand**

* **\[ ] Inspect the Pump Stand:**
  * Check that the roughing pump, turbo pump, pressure gauge, and automatic flooding valve are operational.
  * Ensure all seals and connections on the pump stand are intact. Check that it is clean and its recent history.
* **\[ ] Connect the Pump Stand to the Chambers Corner Valve:**
  * Clean all mating surfaces and seals to prevent contamination.
  * Securely attach the pump stand to the chamber via the corner valve flange.
  * Tighten bolts uniformly in a crisscross pattern to ensure even pressure.
* **\[ ] Verify Connections:**
  * Ensure all connections between the pump stand and the chamber are leak-tight.

***

#### **4. Evacuating and final test of the Pump Stand**

* **\[ ] Start the Roughing Pump:**
  * Turn on the roughing pump to evacuate the pump stand and its lines. The Turbo pump will start automatically.
  * Monitor the pressure gauge on the pump stand.
* **\[ ] Wait for Initial Vacuum:**
  * Allow the pump stand to reach a high vacuum of lower than \~1×10⁻5 mbar.
* **\[ ] Prepare Nitrogen Venting:**
  * Ensure high-purity nitrogen gas (dry, oil-free) is connected to the automatic flooding valve.
  * Ensure proper pressure levels – about 10 % above atmosheirc pressure levels.&#x20;
  * NOTE: CF flanges cannot handle large pressure differences!
* **\[ ] Activate the Flooding Procedure:**
  * Swtch off of the pump stand will automatically initiate flooding via vent, when turbo pump reached safe rotation speeds.
  * Test vent this section, while the corner valve to UHV chamber is still closed!
* **\[ ] Restart the Pump Stand:**
  * Check vacuum levels again.

***

#### **5. Venting the Chamber**

* **\[ ] Open the Corner Valve Gradually:**
  * Slowly open the corner valve to equalize pressure between the pump stand and the chamber.
* **\[ ] Monitor Pressure and Current of the Ion Getter Pump:**
  * Use the pressure gauges and the current monitor of the IGP to track the chamber and pump stand pressures for a few minutes.
* **\[ ] Turn off the ion getter pump and main champer pressure gauge:**
  * To prevent damage during flooding turn all main chamber equipment off.
* **\[ ] Activate the Flooding Procedure:**
  * Monitor pressure levels and pump status.
* **\[ ] Equalize to Atmospheric Pressure:**
  * Continue venting and keep N2 flow on during maintenance work.

***

#### **6. Accessing the Chamber**

* **\[ ] Confirm Atmospheric Pressure:**
  * Double-check that the chamber is fully vented and at or slightly above atmospheric pressure.
* **\[ ] Open the Chamber Carefully:**
  * Remove flanges or viewports as needed, placing them on clean, lint-free surfaces.
* **\[ ] Maintain Cleanliness:**
  * Avoid touching internal surfaces with bare hands.
  * Use clean tools and handle components with care to prevent contamination.

***

#### **7. Removing the Old Component**

* **\[ ] Document the OLD Setup:**
  * Take photos or detailed notes of the component's position and connections.
* **\[ ] Remove Gently:**
  * Carefully disconnect any electrical or mechanical connections.
  * Detach the component without applying excessive force.
* **\[ ] Inspect for Contamination:**
  * Check the surrounding area for any signs of debris or residue.

***

#### **8. Installing the New Component**

* **\[ ] Final clean of the New Components if neccessary:**
  * Check all components and tools before bringing them into cotact with clean UHV chamber.
  * Use cleanroom wipes and appropriate solvents to remove any contaminants if neccessary.
* **\[ ] Install with Care:**
  * Position the component precisely where the old one was located.
  * Reconnect any electrical or mechanical interfaces.
* **Document the NEW Setup:**
  * Take photos or detailed notes of the component's position and connections.
* **\[ ] Replace Seals:**
  * Install new, clean gaskets compatible with UHV conditions.
* **\[ ] Reassemble the Chamber:**
  * Reattach flanges and viewports.
  * Tighten bolts in a crisscross pattern to ensure even sealing pressure.

***

#### **9. Initial Pump Down**

* **\[ ] Verify All Seals:**
  * Inspect all flanges, ports, and connections for proper sealing.
* **\[ ] Start pump stand:**
  * The roughing pump begins evacuating the chamber.
  * Ensure the nitrogen flooding valve is fully closed.
  * Watch the pressure gauge as the chamber pressure decreases.
  * Monitor the turbo pump current and rotational speed for proper operation.

***

#### **10. UHV Pump Activation**

* **\[ ] Reach Crossover Pressure:**
  * Continue pumping until the pressure is suitable for activating UHV pumps (\~1×10⁻6 mbar).
* **\[ ] Start the Ion Getter Pump:**
  * Follow the manufacturer's procedures to activate the ion pump.
  * Monitor current and pressure to ensure proper operation.
* **\[ ] Activate the Titanium Sublimation Pump:**
  * Wait until pressure is below \~1×10⁻9 mbar.
  * Heat the titanium filament according to guidelines to deposit fresh titanium.
* **\[ ] Monitor System Performance:**
  * Regularly check pressure readings and pump statuses.
* **\[ ] Close the Corner Valve:**
  * Once suitable conditions are achieved, you may isolate the chamber by closing the corner valve.

***

#### **Final Checks**

* **\[ ] Achieve Target Pressure:**
  * Verify that the chamber reaches the desired pressure of 1×10⁻¹¹ mbar.
* **\[ ] Gett ready for bakeout (if required)**
* **\[ ] Leak Testing:**
  * Perform a helium leak test around all seals and connections.
  * Use a mass spectrometer leak detector for accurate results.
* **\[ ] System Verification:**
  * Check that all pumps are operating within specifications.
  * Ensure that gauges and sensors provide accurate readings.
* **\[ ] Documentation:**
  * Record all procedures, settings, and any issues encountered.
  * Update maintenance logs and component inventories.

***

#### **Safety Considerations**

* **Handling UHV Components:**
  * Wear appropriate PPE to prevent contamination and injury.
  * Handle delicate components with tools designed for UHV applications.
* **Nitrogen Gas Use:**
  * Ensure adequate room ventilation when venting with nitrogen.
  * Be aware of asphyxiation hazards due to nitrogen displacing oxygen.
* **Electrical Safety:**
  * Be cautious of high voltages associated with ion pumps.
  * Lockout/tagout electrical equipment before maintenance.
* **Thermal Hazards:**
  * Use insulated gloves when handling hot components during bake-out.
  * Allow sufficient cooling time before touching heated areas.
* **Vacuum Safety:**
  * Never vent the chamber rapidly; rapid pressure changes can cause damage.
  * Be cautious of mechanical movements due to pressure differentials.

***

**Note:** Maintaining strict cleanliness protocols is crucial for achieving ultra-high vacuum conditions. Even minor contaminants can significantly impact vacuum levels and system performance. Avoid that UHV chamber is exposed to air for more than 1 hour – keep flooding with clean N2.
