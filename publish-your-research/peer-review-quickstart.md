# Peer Review Quickstart

### Your Mission

As a reviewer, your role is to **protect quality and fairness**. You are not just evaluating research — you are ensuring clarity, rigor, and trust in the scientific record.

***

### Review Steps

#### 1) **Big Picture Check**

* Does the paper clearly state its main contribution?
* Is it accessible to a broad physics audience?
* Are risks, limitations, or trade‑offs acknowledged?

#### 2) **Detail Check**

* Are the methods appropriate and rigorous?
* Are results supported by data and statistics?
* Are uncertainties and systematic effects discussed?

#### 3) **Context Check**

* Does the paper fairly reference relevant prior work?
* Are alternative approaches or platforms acknowledged?

#### 4) **Improvement Suggestions**

* Point out weaknesses with **specific manuscript locations** (section, figure, line).
* Suggest **clear, actionable changes** (clarify claims, add analysis, improve figures).

#### 5) **Stop Criteria**

You should recommend **reject** if the paper is:

* Fundamentally flawed, irreproducible, or misleading.
* Making unsupported or overstated claims.
* Missing essential novelty, rigor, or reproducibility.

### Integrity & Bias Check (Before Scoring)

* **Conflicts of interest?** If yes, recuse. Include both direct (collaborations, funding, same institution) and indirect (competitor labs, recent disputes) conflicts.
* **Expertise level?** State if only partial and note which domains you can fairly assess.
* **Bias awareness:** Reflect on whether your judgment could be affected by:
  * First impression bias (initial reaction to abstract)
  * Confirmation bias (favoring expected outcomes)
  * Competitor bias (research overlap, rivalry)
  * Citation bias (favoring own work/collaborators)
  * Institutional bias (prestigious vs. lesser‑known labs)
  * Methodology bias (preference for familiar techniques)

### Scoring Matrix

Choose journal tier → weights adjust (e.g., PRL = breakthrough, PRA = fundamental, PRXQ = applied).

**Scores:** 3 Exceptional · 2 Acceptable · 1 Needs Improvement · 0 Insufficient

| Domain                   | Weight | Score (0–3) | Comment |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Originality & Novelty    |        |             |         |
| Scientific Rigor         |        |             |         |
| Data Analysis            |        |             |         |
| Statistics & Systematics |        |             |         |
| Clarity & Presentation   |        |             |         |
| Literature Context       |        |             |         |
| Significance & Impact    |        |             |         |
| Reproducibility          |        |             |         |
| Figures & Tables         |        |             |         |
| Conclusions & Outlook    |        |             |         |
| **TOTAL**                | –      | –           |         |

**Thresholds**

* ≥85% → Accept
* 70–84% → Minor revisions
* 50–69% → Revise & resubmit
* <50% → Reject

**Overrides:**

* Originality, Rigor, or Reproducibility = 0 → Reject.
* Impact = 0 but total ≥70% → Transfer to lower‑tier journal.

### Narrative Feedback

Write **1–2 paragraphs per domain**, covering:

* Strengths.
* Weaknesses with manuscript references.
* Actionable fixes.

***

### Final Checks

* Avoid all‑3 or all‑0 scoring unless justified.
* High claims must match strong rigor.
* Stay within your expertise.
* Confirm independence from authors.

***

#### Quick Tips

* Be specific: _“Fig. 2 lacks error bars”_ > _“Unclear data.”_
* Always suggest fixes, not just problems.
* Be constructive and fair: aim to **help improve the paper**, not just judge it.
