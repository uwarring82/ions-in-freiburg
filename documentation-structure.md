# Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into three functionally distinct categories. Each serves a different epistemic role, and materials should be read with awareness of these boundaries.

### Essays

Essays contain interpretive, motivating, and contextual material. They reflect how specific people understand and apply the concepts in their work. Essays may include personal perspectives, historical development notes, and illustrative examples. They are not normative—readers are free to develop alternative interpretations. Essays provide _keys_ for unlocking concepts, not definitions of the concepts themselves.

### Invariant Frameworks

Invariant frameworks specify minimal, non-normative constraints that must hold regardless of implementation choices, and whose violation precludes the claimed system property. These are conceptual _locks_—stable boundaries that define what a concept is by stating what it cannot violate. Frameworks do not prescribe methods, procedures, or best practices. They establish falsifiable conditions (e.g., "signal comparison cannot exceed causal reach: L ≤ cτ") without specifying how those conditions should be satisfied. If a framework proves incorrect, it is revised or discarded; it cannot be "interpreted away."

### Implementation Interfaces

Implementation interfaces document operational, revisable practices developed by specific groups for specific contexts. These are _working keys_—they instantiate invariant frameworks in particular settings, but they are neither unique nor authoritative. The Causal Synchronization Protocol (CSP) is one such interface; others may emerge as different communities apply the same underlying frameworks to their own problems. Interfaces evolve with use. They are shared to enable coordination and cross-validation, not to establish standards or compliance requirements.

**Navigational principle**: Start with frameworks to understand constraints, consult essays for context, examine interfaces for operational guidance. No section can substitute for another.
